through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
have	1

And	1
we	1

that	1

been	1
translated	1
by	1
the	1
gift	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
his	1

hath	1
declared	1

unto	1

wherefore	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
is	1
true	1
And	1
we	1
also	1
testify	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
engravings	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1

by	1
the	1

God	1
and	1
not	1

And	1
we	1
declare	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
soberness	1
that	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
and	1
laid	1

that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
marvelous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
bear	1
record	1
of	1
it	1
wherefore	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
we	1
bear	1
testimony	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
faithful	1
in	1
Christ	1
we	1
shall	1
rid	1
our	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
all	1

be	1

I	1
Nephi	1
having	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
goodly	1
parents	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
taught	1
somewhat	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
learning	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
having	1
seen	1
many	1
afflictions	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
days	1
nevertheless	1
having	1
been	1
highly	1
favored	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
days	1
yea	1
having	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
therefore	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
proceedings	1
in	1
my	1
days	1
1	1
Nephi	1
12	1
2	1
Yea	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
learning	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
1	1
Nephi	1
13	1
3	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
is	1
true	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
1	1
Nephi	1
14	1

For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
having	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
prophets	1
prophesying	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
repent	1
or	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
Jerusalem	1
must	1
be	1
destroyed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
15	1
5	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
even	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
a	1
rock	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
much	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
he	1
did	1
quake	1
and	1
tremble	1
exceedingly	1
1	1
Nephi	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
bed	1
being	1
overcome	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
1	1
Nephi	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
being	1
thus	1
overcome	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
he	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
God	1
sitting	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
surrounded	1
with	1
numberless	1
concourses	1
of	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
singing	1
and	1
praising	1
their	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
19	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
One	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
his	1
luster	1
was	1
above	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
noonday	1
1	1
Nephi	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
twelve	1
others	1
following	1
him	1
and	1
their	1
brightness	1
did	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
1	1
Nephi	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
read	1
1	1
Nephi	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
he	1
read	1
saying	1
Wo	1
wo	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thine	1
abominations	1
Yea	1
and	1
many	1
things	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
read	1
concerning	1
Jerusalemthat	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
many	1
should	1
perish	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
many	1
should	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon	1
1	1
Nephi	1
114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
read	1
and	1
seen	1
many	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
exclaim	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
such	1
as	1
Great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
are	1
thy	1
works	1
O	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
Thy	1
throne	1
is	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
thy	1
power	1
and	1
goodness	1
and	1
mercy	1
are	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
merciful	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
suffer	1
those	1
who	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
1	1
Nephi	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
was	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
praising	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
did	1
rejoice	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
was	1
filled	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
yea	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shown	1
unto	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
hath	1
written	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
written	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
visions	1
and	1
in	1
dreams	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
written	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
prophesied	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
children	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
1	1
Nephi	1
117	1
17	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
proceedings	1
in	1
my	1
days	1
Behold	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
abridgment	1
of	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
upon	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hands	1
wherefore	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
abridged	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
life	1
1	1
Nephi	1
118	1
18	1
Therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shown	1
so	1
many	1
marvelous	1
things	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
yea	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
behold	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
prophesy	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
1	1
Nephi	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
did	1
mock	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
testified	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
he	1
truly	1
testified	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
and	1
he	1
testified	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
manifested	1
plainly	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Messiah	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
heard	1
these	1
things	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
yea	1
even	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
old	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
stoned	1
and	1
slain	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
sought	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
away	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
Nephi	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
tender	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
over	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
mighty	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
deliverance	1

1	1
Nephi	1
21	1
1	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Lehi	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
and	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
and	1
declared	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee	1
behold	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
life	1
1	1
Nephi	1
22	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
my	1
father	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
23	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
his	1
gold	1
and	1
his	1
silver	1
and	1
his	1
precious	1
things	1
and	1
took	1
nothing	1
with	1
him	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
provisions	1
and	1
tents	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
borders	1
near	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
he	1
traveled	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
which	1
are	1
nearer	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
Sariah	1
and	1
my	1
elder	1
brothers	1
who	1
were	1
Laman	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
Sam	1
1	1
Nephi	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
traveled	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
he	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
in	1
a	1
valley	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
1	1
Nephi	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
28	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Laman	1
and	1
it	1
emptied	1
into	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
near	1
the	1
mouth	1
thereof	1
1	1
Nephi	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
emptied	1
into	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Laman	1
saying	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
river	1
continually	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
210	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
spake	1
unto	1
Lemuel	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
valley	1
firm	1
and	1
steadfast	1
and	1
immovable	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
211	1
11	1
Now	1
this	1
he	1
spake	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
stiffneckedness	1
of	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
murmur	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
against	1
their	1
father	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
visionary	1
man	1
and	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
to	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
foolish	1
imaginations	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
1	1
Nephi	1
212	1
12	1
And	1
thus	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
being	1
the	1
eldest	1
did	1
murmur	1
against	1
their	1
father	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
murmur	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
dealings	1
of	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
had	1
created	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
213	1
13	1
Neither	1
did	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
could	1
be	1
destroyed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Lemuel	1
with	1
power	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
until	1
their	1
frames	1
did	1
shake	1
before	1
him	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
confound	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
utter	1
against	1
him	1
wherefore	1
they	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
215	1
15	1
And	1
my	1
father	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
1	1
Nephi	1
216	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
young	1
nevertheless	1
being	1
large	1
in	1
stature	1
and	1
also	1
having	1
great	1
desires	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
wherefore	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
visit	1
me	1
and	1
did	1
soften	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
wherefore	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
rebel	1
against	1
him	1
like	1
unto	1
my	1
brothers	1
1	1
Nephi	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
Sam	1
making	1
known	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
manifested	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
my	1
words	1
1	1
Nephi	1
218	1
18	1
But	1
behold	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
being	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Nephi	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
sought	1
me	1
diligently	1
with	1
lowliness	1
of	1
heart	1
1	1
Nephi	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
for	1
you	1
yea	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
1	1
Nephi	1
221	1
21	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
thy	1
brethren	1
shall	1
rebel	1
against	1
thee	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
over	1
thy	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
223	1
23	1
For	1
behold	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
rebel	1
against	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
curse	1
them	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
curse	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
thy	1
seed	1
except	1
they	1
shall	1
rebel	1
against	1
me	1
also	1
1	1
Nephi	1
224	1
24	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
rebel	1
against	1
me	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
scourge	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
remembrance	1
1	1

Chapter	1
3	1
1	1
Nephi	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
returned	1
from	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
32	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
33	1
3	1
For	1
behold	1
Laban	1
hath	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
genealogy	1
of	1
my	1
forefathers	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
engraven	1
upon	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
1	1
Nephi	1
34	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
brothers	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
seek	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
hither	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
35	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
thy	1
brothers	1
murmur	1
saying	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
required	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
required	1
it	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
36	1
6	1
Therefore	1
go	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
favored	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
murmured	1
1	1
Nephi	1
37	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
giveth	1
no	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
save	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
accomplish	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
commandeth	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
took	1
our	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
our	1
tents	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
did	1
consult	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
1	1
Nephi	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
we	1
cast	1
lotswho	1
of	1
us	1
should	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Laman	1
and	1
Laman	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
1	1
Nephi	1
312	1
12	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
of	1
Laban	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Laban	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
thrust	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
records	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
robber	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
thee	1
1	1
Nephi	1
314	1
14	1
But	1
Laman	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Laban	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
us	1
And	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
315	1
15	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
As	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
accomplished	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
316	1
16	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
inheritance	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
left	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
riches	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
317	1
17	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1
must	1
be	1
destroyed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
318	1
18	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
my	1
father	1
should	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
commanded	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
behold	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
perish	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
1	1
Nephi	1
319	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
wisdom	1
in	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
obtain	1
these	1
records	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
unto	1
our	1
children	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
1	1
Nephi	1
320	1
20	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
even	1
down	1
unto	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
1	1
Nephi	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
did	1
I	1
persuade	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
our	1
gold	1
and	1
our	1
silver	1
and	1
our	1
precious	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
323	1
23	1
And	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
gathered	1
these	1
things	1
together	1
we	1
went	1
up	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
1	1
Nephi	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Laban	1
and	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
for	1
which	1
we	1
would	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
our	1
gold	1
and	1
our	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
precious	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Laban	1
saw	1
our	1
property	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
he	1
did	1
lust	1
after	1
it	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
thrust	1
us	1
out	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
slay	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
obtain	1
our	1
property	1
1	1
Nephi	1
326	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
behind	1
our	1
property	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Laban	1
1	1
Nephi	1
327	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Laban	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
hid	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
cavity	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
1	1
Nephi	1
328	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Laman	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
was	1
Lemuel	1
for	1
he	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Laman	1
Wherefore	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
did	1
speak	1
many	1
hard	1
words	1
unto	1
us	1
their	1
younger	1
brothers	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
smite	1
us	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
1	1
Nephi	1
329	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
smote	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
behold	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
smite	1
your	1
younger	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
you	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
deliver	1
Laban	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
1	1
Nephi	1
330	1
30	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
angel	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
he	1
departed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
331	1
31	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
angel	1
had	1
departed	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
saying	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
deliver	1
Laban	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
Behold	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
can	1
command	1
fifty	1
yea	1
even	1
he	1
can	1
slay	1
fifty	1
then	1
why	1
not	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
4	1
Chapter	1
4	1
1	1
Nephi	1
41	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
saying	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
again	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
then	1
why	1
not	1
mightier	1
than	1
Laban	1
and	1
his	1
fifty	1
yea	1
or	1
even	1
than	1
his	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
1	1
Nephi	1
42	1
2	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
strong	1
like	1
unto	1
Moses	1
for	1
he	1
truly	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
they	1
divided	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
came	1
through	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
did	1
follow	1
and	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
1	1
Nephi	1
43	1
3	1
Now	1
behold	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
true	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
angel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
wherefore	1
can	1
ye	1
doubt	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
Laban	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
1	1
Nephi	1
44	1
4	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
wroth	1
and	1
did	1
still	1
continue	1
to	1
murmur	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
follow	1
me	1
up	1
until	1
we	1
came	1
without	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
45	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
hide	1
themselves	1
without	1
the	1
walls	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
hid	1
themselves	1
I	1
Nephi	1
crept	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
1	1
Nephi	1
46	1
6	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
not	1
knowing	1
beforehand	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
1	1
Nephi	1
47	1
7	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Laban	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
drunken	1
with	1
wine	1
1	1
Nephi	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Laban	1
1	1
Nephi	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
I	1
drew	1
it	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
sheath	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
hilt	1
thereof	1
was	1
of	1
pure	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
workmanship	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fine	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
blade	1
thereof	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
steel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
constrained	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
kill	1
Laban	1
but	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
Never	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
man	1
And	1
I	1
shrunk	1
and	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
slay	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
411	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
mine	1
own	1
life	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
had	1
taken	1
away	1
our	1
property	1
1	1
Nephi	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
Slay	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
1	1
Nephi	1
413	1
13	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
slayeth	1
the	1
wicked	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
his	1
righteous	1
purposes	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
perish	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
nation	1
should	1
dwindle	1
and	1
perish	1
in	1
unbelief	1
1	1
Nephi	1
414	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
saying	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
they	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
1	1
Nephi	1
415	1
15	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
save	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
law	1
1	1
Nephi	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
1	1
Nephi	1
417	1
17	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
delivered	1
Laban	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
for	1
this	1
causethat	1
I	1
might	1
obtain	1
the	1
records	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
commandments	1
1	1
Nephi	1
418	1
18	1
Therefore	1
I	1
did	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
took	1
Laban	1
by	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
I	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
1	1
Nephi	1
419	1
19	1
And	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
smitten	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
mine	1
own	1
body	1
yea	1
even	1
every	1
whit	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
gird	1
on	1
his	1
armor	1
about	1
my	1
loins	1
1	1
Nephi	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
I	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
treasury	1
of	1
Laban	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
forth	1
towards	1
the	1
treasury	1
of	1
Laban	1
behold	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Laban	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
treasury	1
And	1
I	1
commanded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Laban	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
treasury	1
1	1
Nephi	1
421	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
supposed	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
master	1
Laban	1
for	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
garments	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
sword	1
girded	1
about	1
my	1
loins	1
1	1
Nephi	1
422	1
22	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
concerning	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
he	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
Laban	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
by	1
night	1
among	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
423	1
23	1
And	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
Laban	1
1	1
Nephi	1
424	1
24	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
carry	1
the	1
engravings	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
to	1
my	1
elder	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
without	1
the	1
walls	1
1	1
Nephi	1
425	1
25	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
bade	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
follow	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
426	1
26	1
And	1
he	1
supposing	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
truly	1
that	1
Laban	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
slain	1
wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
follow	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
427	1
27	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
many	1
times	1
concerning	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
without	1
the	1
walls	1
1	1
Nephi	1
428	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Laman	1
saw	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
frightened	1
and	1
also	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
Sam	1
And	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
presence	1
for	1
they	1
supposed	1
it	1
was	1
Laban	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
me	1
and	1
had	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
lives	1
also	1
1	1
Nephi	1
429	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
called	1
after	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
hear	1
me	1
wherefore	1
they	1
did	1
cease	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
my	1
presence	1
1	1
Nephi	1
430	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Laban	1
beheld	1
my	1
brethren	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
431	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
large	1
in	1
stature	1
and	1
also	1
having	1
received	1
much	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
I	1
did	1
seize	1
upon	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
flee	1
1	1
Nephi	1
432	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
live	1
even	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
our	1
words	1
we	1
would	1
spare	1
his	1
life	1
1	1
Nephi	1
433	1
33	1
And	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
even	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
free	1
man	1
like	1
unto	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
434	1
34	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
Surely	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
and	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
be	1
diligent	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
place	1
with	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
435	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zoram	1
did	1
take	1
courage	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
Now	1
Zoram	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
made	1
an	1
oath	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
tarry	1
with	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
436	1
36	1
Now	1
we	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
tarry	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
might	1
not	1
know	1
concerning	1
our	1
flight	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
pursue	1
us	1
and	1
destroy	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
437	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Zoram	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
oath	1
unto	1
us	1
our	1
fears	1
did	1
cease	1
concerning	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
438	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
took	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
journeyed	1
unto	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
5	1
Chapter	1
5	1
1	1
Nephi	1
51	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
mother	1
Sariah	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
for	1
she	1
truly	1
had	1
mourned	1
because	1
of	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
52	1
2	1
For	1
she	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
she	1
also	1
had	1
complained	1
against	1
my	1
father	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
visionary	1
man	1
saying	1
Behold	1
thou	1
hast	1
led	1
us	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
and	1
my	1
sons	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
we	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
53	1
3	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
had	1
my	1
mother	1
complained	1
against	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
spake	1
unto	1
her	1
saying	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
visionary	1
man	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
had	1
tarried	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
had	1
perished	1
with	1
my	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
55	1
5	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
things	1
I	1
do	1
rejoice	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
deliver	1
my	1
sons	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
again	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
56	1
6	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
comfort	1
my	1
mother	1
Sariah	1
concerning	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
journeyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
1	1
Nephi	1
57	1
7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
behold	1
their	1
joy	1
was	1
full	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
comforted	1
1	1
Nephi	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
saying	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
my	1
husband	1
to	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
protected	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
power	1
whereby	1
they	1
could	1
accomplish	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
them	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
did	1
she	1
speak	1
1	1
Nephi	1
59	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
did	1
offer	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
took	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
search	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
1	1
Nephi	1
511	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
contain	1
the	1
five	1
books	1
of	1
Moses	1
which	1
gave	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
Adam	1
and	1
Eve	1
who	1
were	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
1	1
Nephi	1
512	1
12	1
And	1
also	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
1	1
Nephi	1
513	1
13	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
prophecies	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
1	1
Nephi	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
also	1
found	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
a	1
genealogy	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
wherefore	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Joseph	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
Joseph	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jacob	1
who	1
was	1
sold	1
into	1
Egypt	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
preserved	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
preserve	1
his	1
father	1
Jacob	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
from	1
perishing	1
with	1
famine	1
1	1
Nephi	1
515	1
15	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
that	1
same	1
God	1
who	1
had	1
preserved	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
516	1
16	1
And	1
thus	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
did	1
discover	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
And	1
Laban	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Joseph	1
wherefore	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
fathers	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
records	1
1	1
Nephi	1
517	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
prophesy	1
concerning	1
his	1
seed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
518	1
18	1
That	1
these	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
519	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
these	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
should	1
never	1
perish	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
be	1
dimmed	1
any	1
more	1
by	1
time	1
And	1
he	1
prophesied	1
many	1
things	1
concerning	1
his	1
seed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
520	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
far	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
commandments	1
wherewith	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
521	1
21	1
And	1
we	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
us	1
and	1
searched	1
them	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
desirable	1
yea	1
even	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
us	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
could	1

Wherefore	1
it	1
was	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
carry	1
them	1
with	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
journeyed	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
my	1

neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
after	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
writing	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
kept	1
by	1
my	1

wherefore	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
work	1
1	1
Nephi	1
62	1
2	1
For	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
descendants	1
of	1
Joseph	1
1	1
Nephi	1
63	1

And	1
it	1
mattereth	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
particular	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
for	1
I	1
desire	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
write	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
64	1
4	1
For	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
mine	1
intent	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
persuade	1
men	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1
1	1

Wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1

1	1
Nephi	1
66	1

Wherefore	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
commandment	1
unto	1
my	1
seed	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
occupy	1
these	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
prophesying	1
concerning	1
his	1
seed	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
meet	1
for	1
him	1
Lehi	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
family	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
alone	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
sons	1
should	1
take	1
daughters	1
to	1
wife	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
1	1
Nephi	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
should	1
again	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
bring	1
down	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
again	1
with	1
my	1
brethren	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
gain	1
favor	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
75	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
soften	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
household	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
with	1
us	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
76	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
journeyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
behold	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
did	1
rebel	1
against	1
us	1
yea	1
against	1
me	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Sam	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
other	1
daughters	1
1	1
Nephi	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
rebellion	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
78	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
therefore	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
yea	1
even	1
unto	1
Laman	1
and	1
unto	1
Lemuel	1
Behold	1
ye	1
are	1
mine	1
elder	1
brethren	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
so	1
hard	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
so	1
blind	1
in	1
your	1
minds	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
that	1
I	1
your	1
younger	1
brother	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
and	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
for	1
you	1
1	1
Nephi	1
79	1
9	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
710	1
10	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
711	1
11	1
Yea	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
what	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
delivering	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
obtain	1
the	1
record	1
1	1
Nephi	1
712	1
12	1
Yea	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
exercise	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
713	1
13	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
we	1
shall	1
obtain	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
period	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
1	1
Nephi	1
714	1
14	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
ceaseth	1
soon	1
to	1
strive	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
have	1
they	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
driven	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
1	1
Nephi	1
715	1
15	1
Now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
perish	1
with	1
them	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
choice	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
go	1
ye	1
will	1
also	1
perish	1
for	1
thus	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
constraineth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
speak	1
1	1
Nephi	1
716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
bind	1
me	1
with	1
cords	1
for	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
wild	1
beasts	1
1	1
Nephi	1
717	1
17	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
yea	1
even	1
give	1
me	1
strength	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
burst	1
these	1
bands	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
1	1
Nephi	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
the	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed	1
from	1
off	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
feet	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
again	1
1	1
Nephi	1
719	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
again	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
but	1
behold	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
did	1
plead	1
with	1
my	1
brethren	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
soften	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cease	1
striving	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life	1
1	1
Nephi	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sorrowful	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
did	1
plead	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
forgive	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
against	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
frankly	1
forgive	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
forgiveness	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
praying	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
we	1
did	1
again	1
travel	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
And	1
after	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
they	1
did	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
offer	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
8	1
Chapter	1
8	1
1	1
Nephi	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
seeds	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
both	1
of	1
grain	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
seeds	1
of	1
fruit	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
1	1
Nephi	1
82	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
my	1
father	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
us	1
saying	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
1	1
Nephi	1
83	1
3	1
And	1
behold	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
Sam	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
seed	1
will	1
be	1
saved	1
1	1
Nephi	1
84	1
4	1
But	1
behold	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
I	1
fear	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
behold	1
methought	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
dream	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
dreary	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
85	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
robe	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
86	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
follow	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
87	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
him	1
I	1
beheld	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
dreary	1
waste	1

And	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
traveled	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
hours	1
in	1
darkness	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
tender	1
mercies	1
1	1
Nephi	1
89	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
spacious	1
field	1
1	1
Nephi	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
tree	1
whose	1
fruit	1
was	1
desirable	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
happy	1
1	1
Nephi	1
811	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
sweet	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
before	1
tasted	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
was	1
white	1
to	1
exceed	1
all	1
the	1
whiteness	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
1	1
Nephi	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
partook	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
it	1
filled	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
wherefore	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
desirous	1
that	1
my	1
family	1
should	1
partake	1
of	1
it	1
also	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
desirable	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
813	1
13	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
cast	1
my	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
discover	1
my	1
family	1
also	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
it	1
ran	1
along	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
partaking	1
the	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
to	1
behold	1
from	1
whence	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
head	1
thereof	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
off	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
thereof	1
I	1
beheld	1
your	1
mother	1
Sariah	1
and	1
Sam	1
and	1
Nephi	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
1	1
Nephi	1
815	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
did	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
which	1
was	1
desirable	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
also	1
1	1
Nephi	1
817	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
also	1
wherefore	1
I	1
cast	1
mine	1
eyes	1
towards	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
see	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
818	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
819	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
it	1
extended	1
along	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
stood	1
1	1
Nephi	1
820	1
20	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
beheld	1
a	1
strait	1
and	1
narrow	1
path	1
which	1
came	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
stood	1
and	1
it	1
also	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
unto	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
spacious	1
field	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
821	1
21	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
numberless	1
concourses	1
of	1
people	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
pressing	1
forward	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
the	1
path	1
which	1
led	1
unto	1
the	1
tree	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
stood	1
1	1
Nephi	1
822	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
commence	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
1	1
Nephi	1
823	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
yea	1
even	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
commenced	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
did	1
lose	1
their	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
wandered	1
off	1
and	1
were	1
lost	1
1	1
Nephi	1
824	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
others	1
pressing	1
forward	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
press	1
forward	1
through	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
1	1
Nephi	1
825	1
25	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
partaken	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
their	1
eyes	1
about	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
826	1
26	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
cast	1
my	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
beheld	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
spacious	1
building	1
and	1
it	1
stood	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
827	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
people	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
both	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
and	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
dress	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fine	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
mocking	1
and	1
pointing	1
their	1
fingers	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
and	1
were	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
828	1
28	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
tasted	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
scoffing	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
away	1
into	1
forbidden	1
paths	1
and	1
were	1
lost	1
1	1
Nephi	1
829	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
830	1
30	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
short	1
in	1
writing	1
behold	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
multitudes	1
pressing	1
forward	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
press	1
their	1
way	1
forward	1
continually	1
holding	1
fast	1
to	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
partook	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
1	1
Nephi	1
831	1
31	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
other	1
multitudes	1
feeling	1
their	1
way	1
towards	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
spacious	1
building	1
1	1
Nephi	1
832	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
lost	1
from	1
his	1
view	1
wandering	1
in	1
strange	1
roads	1
1	1
Nephi	1
833	1
33	1
And	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
strange	1
building	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
building	1
they	1
did	1
point	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
scorn	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
also	1
but	1
we	1
heeded	1
them	1
not	1
1	1
Nephi	1
834	1
34	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heeded	1
them	1
had	1
fallen	1
away	1
1	1
Nephi	1
835	1
35	1
And	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
partook	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
said	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
836	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
spoken	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
dream	1
or	1
vision	1
which	1
were	1
many	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
he	1
exceedingly	1
feared	1
for	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
yea	1
he	1
feared	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
837	1
37	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
then	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
tender	1
parent	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
hearken	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
off	1
yea	1
my	1
father	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
838	1
38	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
cease	1
speaking	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
9	1
Chapter	1
9	1
1	1
Nephi	1
91	1
1	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
and	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
1	1
Nephi	1
92	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
these	1
plates	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
plates	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
plates	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nephi	1
wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
name	1
and	1
these	1
plates	1
also	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
1	1
Nephi	1
93	1
3	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
these	1
plates	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
account	1
engraven	1
of	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
94	1
4	1
Upon	1
the	1
other	1
plates	1
should	1
be	1
engraven	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
wherefore	1
these	1
plates	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ministry	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
plates	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
95	1
5	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
plates	1
for	1
a	1
wise	1
purpose	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
purpose	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
1	1
Nephi	1
96	1
6	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
wherefore	1
he	1
prepareth	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
accomplish	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
hath	1
all	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
Amen	1

101	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
proceed	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
of	1
my	1
proceedings	1
and	1
my	1
reign	1
and	1
ministry	1
wherefore	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
mine	1
account	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
1	1

102	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
dream	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
exhorting	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
diligence	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
Jews	1
1	1
Nephi	1
103	1
3	1
That	1
after	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
even	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
many	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
again	1
yea	1
even	1
be	1
brought	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
they	1
should	1
possess	1
again	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
1	1
Nephi	1
104	1
4	1
Yea	1
even	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
prophet	1
would	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
Jewseven	1
a	1
Messiah	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
a	1
Savior	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
105	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
number	1
had	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
concerning	1
this	1
Messiah	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
or	1
this	1
Redeemer	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
106	1
6	1
Wherefore	1
all	1
mankind	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
fallen	1
state	1
and	1
ever	1
would	1
be	1
save	1
they	1
should	1
rely	1
on	1
this	1
Redeemer	1
1	1
Nephi	1
107	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
concerning	1
a	1
prophet	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
Messiah	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
108	1
8	1
Yea	1
even	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight	1
for	1
there	1
standeth	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
whose	1
shoes	1
latchet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose	1
And	1
much	1
spake	1
my	1
father	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
1	1
Nephi	1
109	1
9	1
And	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
baptize	1
in	1
Bethabara	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
baptize	1
with	1
water	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
baptize	1
the	1
Messiah	1
with	1
water	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1010	1
10	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
baptized	1
the	1
Messiah	1
with	1
water	1
he	1
should	1
behold	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
baptized	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1011	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
concerning	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
preached	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
dwindling	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
in	1
unbelief	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
Messiah	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
he	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
should	1
make	1
himself	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1012	1
12	1
Yea	1
even	1
my	1
father	1
spake	1
much	1
concerning	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
compared	1
like	1
unto	1
an	1
olivetree	1
whose	1
branches	1
should	1
be	1
broken	1
off	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
scattered	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1013	1
13	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
led	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
scattered	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1014	1
14	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
should	1
be	1
scattered	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
again	1
or	1
in	1
fine	1
after	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gospel	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
olivetree	1
or	1
the	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
should	1
be	1
grafted	1
in	1
or	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
Messiah	1
their	1
Lord	1
and	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1015	1
15	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
prophesy	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
were	1
expedient	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
mine	1
other	1
book	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1016	1
16	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
were	1
done	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Lemuel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1017	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
I	1
Nephi	1
having	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
power	1
he	1
received	1
by	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
Godand	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
the	1
Messiah	1
who	1
should	1
comeI	1
Nephi	1
was	1
desirous	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
diligently	1
seek	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
old	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1018	1
18	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
prepared	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
repent	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1019	1
19	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
diligently	1
seeketh	1
shall	1
find	1
and	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
unfolded	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
these	1
times	1
as	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
old	1
as	1
in	1
times	1
to	1
come	1
wherefore	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
one	1
eternal	1

Therefore	1
remember	1
O	1
man	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
doings	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
judgment	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1021	1
21	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
sought	1
to	1
do	1
wickedly	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
probation	1
then	1
ye	1
are	1
found	1
unclean	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing	1
can	1
dwell	1
with	1
God	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
forever	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1022	1
22	1
And	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
giveth	1
authority	1
that	1
I	1

speak	1
these	1
things	1
and	1

For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
believing	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
sat	1
pondering	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
I	1
was	1
caught	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
into	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
high	1
mountain	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
before	1
seen	1
and	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
before	1
set	1
my	1
foot	1
1	1
Nephi	1
112	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
what	1
desirest	1
thou	1
1	1
Nephi	1
113	1
3	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
114	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
saw	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
1	1
Nephi	1
115	1
5	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
Yea	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
116	1
6	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
Spirit	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
even	1
above	1
all	1
And	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Nephi	1
because	1
thou	1
believest	1
in	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
desired	1
1	1
Nephi	1
117	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
thing	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
after	1
thou	1
hast	1
beheld	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
bore	1
the	1
fruit	1
which	1
thy	1
father	1
tasted	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
witness	1
and	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
witnessed	1
him	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
118	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
thereof	1
was	1
far	1
beyond	1
yea	1
exceeding	1
of	1
all	1
beauty	1
and	1
the	1
whiteness	1
thereof	1
did	1
exceed	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
driven	1
snow	1
1	1
Nephi	1
119	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
tree	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
I	1
behold	1
thou	1
hast	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
precious	1
above	1
all	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1110	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
What	1
desirest	1
thou	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1111	1
11	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
To	1
know	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereoffor	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
speaketh	1
for	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
yet	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
speaketh	1
with	1
another	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
presence	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
also	1
other	1
cities	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
virgin	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
and	1
white	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
and	1
an	1
angel	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Nephi	1
what	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1115	1
15	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
A	1
virgin	1
most	1
beautiful	1
and	1
fair	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
virgins	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1116	1
16	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
condescension	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1117	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
loveth	1
his	1
children	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1118	1
18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
the	1
virgin	1
whom	1
thou	1
seest	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
time	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Look	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1120	1
20	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
virgin	1
again	1
bearing	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1121	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
thy	1
father	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1122	1
22	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
him	1
saying	1
Yea	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
sheddeth	1
itself	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
desirable	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1123	1
23	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Yea	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
joyous	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1124	1
24	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
going	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
many	1
fall	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1125	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
seen	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
living	1
waters	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
waters	1
are	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1126	1
26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
Look	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
condescension	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1127	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
whom	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
spoken	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
beheld	1
the	1
prophet	1
who	1
should	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
him	1
And	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
was	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
baptized	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
abide	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
dove	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1128	1
28	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
ministering	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory	1
and	1
the	1
multitudes	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1129	1
29	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
beheld	1
twelve	1
others	1
following	1
him	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
face	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
not	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1130	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
again	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
angels	1
descending	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1131	1
31	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
going	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
sick	1
and	1
who	1
were	1
afflicted	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
diseases	1
and	1
with	1
devils	1
and	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
and	1
showed	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
me	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
healed	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
devils	1
and	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1132	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
yea	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God	1
was	1
judged	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1133	1
33	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1134	1
34	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
slain	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
for	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
twelve	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1135	1
35	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
spacious	1
building	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
building	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
Behold	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
thereof	1
yea	1
behold	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1136	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
spacious	1
building	1
was	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
fall	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
Thus	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
that	1
shall	1

Nephi	1
121	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
and	1
behold	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
1	1
Nephi	1
122	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
multitudes	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
battle	1
one	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
wars	1
and	1
rumors	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
great	1
slaughters	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
123	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
many	1
generations	1
pass	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
many	1
cities	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
number	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
124	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
lightnings	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
thunderings	1
and	1
earthquakes	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
noises	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
that	1
they	1
rent	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
mountains	1
tumbling	1
into	1
pieces	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
many	1
cities	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sunk	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
many	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
burned	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
many	1
that	1
did	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
quaking	1
thereof	1
1	1
Nephi	1
125	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
I	1
saw	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
vapor	1
of	1
darkness	1
that	1
it	1
passed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
behold	1
I	1
saw	1
multitudes	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
126	1
6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
127	1
7	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
saw	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
upon	1
twelve	1
others	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
chosen	1
1	1
Nephi	1
128	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Behold	1
the	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
who	1
are	1
chosen	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
129	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Thou	1
rememberest	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
Behold	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
wherefore	1
the	1
twelve	1
ministers	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1210	1
10	1
And	1
these	1
twelve	1
ministers	1
whom	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
shall	1
judge	1
thy	1
seed	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
righteous	1
forever	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
their	1
garments	1
are	1
made	1
white	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1211	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
three	1
generations	1
pass	1
away	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
their	1
garments	1
were	1
white	1
even	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
These	1
are	1
made	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1212	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
also	1
saw	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
who	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
righteousness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1213	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
gathered	1
together	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1214	1
14	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1215	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
seed	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
multitudes	1
against	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
battle	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1216	1
16	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Behold	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
filthy	1
water	1
which	1
thy	1
father	1
saw	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
the	1
depths	1
thereof	1
are	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
hell	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1217	1
17	1
And	1
the	1
mists	1
of	1
darkness	1
are	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
which	1
blindeth	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
hardeneth	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
away	1
into	1
broad	1
roads	1
that	1
they	1
perish	1
and	1
are	1
lost	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1218	1
18	1
And	1
the	1
large	1
and	1
spacious	1
building	1
which	1
thy	1
father	1
saw	1
is	1
vain	1
imaginations	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
gulf	1
divideth	1
them	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Messiah	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
beareth	1
record	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1

from	1
this	1

1	1
Nephi	1
1219	1
19	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
beheld	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
did	1
contend	1
against	1
my	1
seed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
my	1

and	1
the	1

I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1

overpower	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1

that	1
they	1
had	1
overcome	1
my	1

forth	1

multitudes	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1

1	1

1221	1

And	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
multitudes	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
wars	1

rumors	1
of	1

among	1

in	1

And	1
the	1

Behold	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
they	1
became	1
a	1
dark	1

loathsome	1

And	1
it	1

to	1

that	1
the	1

spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Look	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
many	1

And	1
the	1

What	1

thou	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
behold	1
many	1

1	1
Nephi	1
133	1

And	1
he	1

of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
I	1
saw	1
among	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
church	1
1	1

And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
abominable	1
above	1

bringeth	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
this	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
it	1
1	1
Nephi	1
137	1
7	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
saw	1
gold	1

silver	1

scarlets	1
and	1
finetwined	1
linen	1
and	1
all	1

I	1
saw	1
many	1
harlots	1

And	1
the	1

this	1
great	1

abominable	1
church	1
1	1
Nephi	1
139	1
9	1
And	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
do	1
they	1
destroy	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
captivity	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1310	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
many	1
waters	1
and	1
they	1
divided	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
from	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1311	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1312	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
who	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
by	1
the	1
many	1
waters	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
wrought	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1

unto	1
the	1

who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1

1	1
Nephi	1
1313	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
wrought	1
upon	1
other	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
upon	1
the	1
many	1
waters	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1314	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
many	1
multitudes	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
scattered	1
before	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
were	1
smitten	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1315	1
15	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
prosper	1
and	1
obtain	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
and	1
beautiful	1
like	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
slain	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1316	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1317	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
their	1
mother	1
Gentiles	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
also	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1318	1
18	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
battle	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1319	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
were	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
nations	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1320	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
carried	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1321	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1322	1
22	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1323	1
23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Behold	1
it	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
Jew	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
The	1
book	1
that	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
is	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
contains	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
it	1
also	1
containeth	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
record	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
engravings	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
save	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
contain	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1324	1
24	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Thou	1
hast	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
Jew	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
Jew	1
it	1
contained	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
bear	1
record	1
and	1
they	1
bear	1
record	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1325	1
25	1
Wherefore	1
these	1
things	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
Jews	1
in	1
purity	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1326	1
26	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
go	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
from	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
thou	1
seest	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
abominable	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
churches	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1

many	1
parts	1
which	1
are	1
plain	1

of	1
the	1

they	1
taken	1
away	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1327	1
27	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
blind	1
the	1
eyes	1

harden	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1328	1
28	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1

that	1
after	1

hath	1
gone	1
forth	1
through	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1

the	1

For	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
according	1
to	1

Nephi	1
145	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
Nephi	1
saying	1
Thou	1
hast	1
beheld	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
repent	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
thou	1
also	1
knowest	1
concerning	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
thou	1

heard	1
that	1
whoso	1
repenteth	1
not	1
must	1
perish	1
1	1
Nephi	1
146	1
6	1
Therefore	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1

1	1
Nephi	1
147	1
7	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
saith	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
work	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1

a	1

which	1
shall	1
be	1
everlasting	1
either	1
on	1

on	1
the	1
othereither	1
to	1
the	1

of	1

unto	1
peace	1

or	1
unto	1
the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
the	1

of	1

the	1
blindness	1

unto	1
their	1
being	1
brought	1
down	1
into	1
captivity	1

also	1
into	1
destruction	1
both	1
temporally	1

spiritually	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
1	1
Nephi	1
148	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Rememberest	1
thou	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
1	1
Nephi	1
149	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Look	1
and	1
behold	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
abominations	1
whose	1
founder	1
is	1
the	1
devil	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1410	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
there	1
are	1
save	1
two	1
churches	1
only	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
wherefore	1
whoso	1
belongeth	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
belongeth	1
to	1
that	1
great	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
whore	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1411	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
whore	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
upon	1
many	1
waters	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1412	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
its	1
numbers	1
were	1
few	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
whore	1
who	1
sat	1
upon	1
many	1
waters	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
God	1
were	1
also	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
their	1
dominions	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
small	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whore	1
whom	1
I	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
mother	1
of	1
abominations	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
multitudes	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1414	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
descended	1
upon	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
covenant	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
were	1
scattered	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
armed	1
with	1
righteousness	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
great	1
glory	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1415	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
wars	1

And	1
as	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
wars	1
and	1

of	1
wars	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1

the	1

spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Behold	1
the	1

upon	1
the	1

behold	1
thou	1
seest	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1417	1
17	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
the	1

of	1
God	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1

then	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1

commence	1
in	1

to	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1418	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Look	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1419	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
robe	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1420	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1421	1
21	1
Behold	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
write	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1422	1
22	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
write	1
concerning	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1423	1
23	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
write	1
are	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
thou	1
beheld	1
proceeding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
book	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
were	1
plain	1
and	1
pure	1
and	1
most	1
precious	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1424	1
24	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
this	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
write	1
are	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
remainder	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1425	1
25	1
But	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
hereafter	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
write	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
ordained	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
write	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1426	1
26	1
And	1
also	1
others	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
them	1
hath	1
he	1
shown	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
written	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
sealed	1
up	1
to	1
come	1
forth	1
in	1
their	1
purity	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb	1
in	1
the	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1427	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
heard	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
was	1
John	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1428	1
28	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
Nephi	1
am	1
forbidden	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
write	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1429	1
29	1
And	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
make	1
them	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1430	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
are	1
true	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
Amen	1

Chapter	1

1	1
Nephi	1
151	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
seen	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
1	1
Nephi	1
152	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
disputing	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
153	1
3	1
For	1
he	1
truly	1
spake	1
many	1
great	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
save	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
being	1
hard	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
1	1
Nephi	1
154	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
was	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
knew	1
they	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
155	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
overcome	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
afflictions	1
for	1
I	1
considered	1
that	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
were	1
great	1
above	1
all	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
beheld	1
their	1
fall	1
1	1
Nephi	1
156	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
received	1
strength	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
desiring	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
disputations	1
1	1
Nephi	1
157	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
Behold	1
we	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
olivetree	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
1	1
Nephi	1
158	1
8	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Have	1
ye	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
159	1
9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
maketh	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1510	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
perish	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1511	1
11	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
saidIf	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
harden	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
ask	1
me	1
in	1
faith	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
with	1
diligence	1
in	1
keeping	1
my	1
commandments	1
surely	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1512	1
12	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
compared	1
unto	1
an	1
olivetree	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
our	1
father	1
and	1
behold	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
broken	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1513	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
meaneth	1
concerning	1
the	1
grafting	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
through	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
when	1
our	1
seed	1
shall	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
yea	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
many	1
generations	1
after	1
the	1
Messiah	1
shall	1
be	1
manifested	1
in	1
body	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
Messiah	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
our	1
seed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1514	1
14	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
our	1
seed	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
covenant	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
forefathers	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
which	1
was	1
ministered	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
by	1
him	1
wherefore	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
doctrine	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1515	1
15	1
And	1
then	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
rejoice	1
and	1
give	1
praise	1
unto	1
their	1
everlasting	1
God	1
their	1
rock	1
and	1
their	1
salvation	1
Yea	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
nourishment	1
from	1
the	1
true	1
vine	1
Yea	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
true	1
fold	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1516	1
16	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
remembered	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
grafted	1
in	1
being	1
a	1
natural	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
olivetree	1
into	1
the	1
true	1
olivetree	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1517	1
17	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
our	1
father	1
meaneth	1
and	1
he	1
meaneth	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
until	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
scattered	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
he	1
meaneth	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
may	1
show	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
cause	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1518	1
18	1
Wherefore	1
our	1
father	1
hath	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
our	1
seed	1
alone	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
which	1
covenant	1
the	1
Lord	1
made	1
to	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham	1
saying	1
In	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1519	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
spake	1
much	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
yea	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1520	1
20	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
rehearse	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
who	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
restored	1
they	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
confounded	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
be	1
scattered	1
again	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
speak	1
many	1
words	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
pacified	1
and	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1521	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
saying	1
What	1
meaneth	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1522	1
22	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1523	1
23	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
iron	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
saw	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1524	1
24	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
whose	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
would	1
hold	1
fast	1
unto	1
it	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
perish	1
neither	1
could	1
the	1
temptations	1
and	1
the	1
fiery	1
darts	1
of	1
the	1
adversary	1
overpower	1
them	1
unto	1
blindness	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
away	1
to	1
destruction	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1525	1
25	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
heed	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
I	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
energies	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
faculty	1
which	1
I	1
possessed	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
remember	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
always	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1526	1
26	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
saw	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1527	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
was	1
filthiness	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
his	1
mind	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
beheld	1
not	1
the	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1528	1
28	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
gulf	1
which	1
separated	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1529	1
29	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
that	1
awful	1
hell	1
which	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1530	1
30	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
our	1
father	1
also	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
also	1
divide	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
brightness	1
thereof	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire	1
which	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
unto	1
God	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
hath	1
no	1
end	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1531	1
31	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Doth	1
this	1
thing	1
mean	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
probation	1
or	1
doth	1
it	1
mean	1
the	1
final	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
temporal	1
body	1
or	1
doth	1
it	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
temporal	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1532	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
things	1
both	1
temporal	1
and	1
spiritual	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
should	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
their	1
works	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
temporal	1
body	1
in	1
their	1
days	1
of	1
probation	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1533	1
33	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
die	1
in	1
their	1
wickedness	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
also	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual	1
which	1
are	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
wherefore	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
works	1
have	1
been	1
filthiness	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
filthy	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
filthy	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
if	1
so	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
must	1
be	1
filthy	1
also	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1534	1
34	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
filthy	1
and	1
there	1
cannot	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
wherefore	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
filthiness	1
prepared	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
filthy	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1535	1
35	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
awful	1
hell	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
the	1
preparator	1
of	1
it	1
wherefore	1
the	1
final	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
justice	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1536	1
36	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
rejected	1
from	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
that	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
whose	1
fruit	1
is	1
most	1
precious	1
and	1
most	1
desirable	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
fruits	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
Amen	1
1	1
Nephi	1
16	1
Chapter	1
16	1
1	1
Nephi	1
161	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
my	1
brethren	1
behold	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Thou	1
hast	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
hard	1
things	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
1	1
Nephi	1
162	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
spoken	1
hard	1
things	1
against	1
the	1
wicked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
the	1
righteous	1
have	1
I	1
justified	1
and	1
testified	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
wherefore	1
the	1
guilty	1
taketh	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
be	1
hard	1
for	1
it	1
cutteth	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
center	1
1	1
Nephi	1
163	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
if	1
ye	1
were	1
righteous	1
and	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
give	1
heed	1
unto	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
walk	1
uprightly	1
before	1
God	1
then	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
murmur	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
say	1
Thou	1
speakest	1
hard	1
things	1
against	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
164	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
exhort	1
my	1
brethren	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
165	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
joy	1
and	1
great	1
hopes	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
righteousness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
166	1
6	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
said	1
and	1
done	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
Lemuel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
167	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
wife	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
brethren	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
wife	1
and	1
also	1
Zoram	1
took	1
the	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
wife	1
1	1
Nephi	1
168	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
And	1
also	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
been	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
exceedingly	1
1	1
Nephi	1
169	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1610	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
arose	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
door	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
astonishment	1
he	1
beheld	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
a	1
round	1
ball	1
of	1
curious	1
workmanship	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
brass	1
And	1
within	1
the	1
ball	1
were	1
two	1
spindles	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
pointed	1
the	1
way	1
whither	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1611	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
we	1
should	1
carry	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
provisions	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
seed	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
carry	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1612	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
our	1
tents	1
and	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
across	1
the	1
river	1
Laman	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1613	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
traveled	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
days	1
nearly	1
a	1
southsoutheast	1
direction	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
again	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
call	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Shazer	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1614	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
our	1
bows	1
and	1
our	1
arrows	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
slay	1
food	1
for	1
our	1
families	1
and	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
slain	1
food	1
for	1
our	1
families	1
we	1
did	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
our	1
families	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Shazer	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
following	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
keeping	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
fertile	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
near	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1615	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
travel	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
slaying	1
food	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
our	1
bows	1
and	1
our	1
arrows	1
and	1
our	1
stones	1
and	1
our	1
slings	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1616	1
16	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
follow	1
the	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
which	1
led	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
fertile	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1617	1
17	1
And	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
traveled	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
again	1
rest	1
ourselves	1
and	1
obtain	1
food	1
for	1
our	1
families	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1618	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
Nephi	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
slay	1
food	1
behold	1
I	1
did	1
break	1
my	1
bow	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
fine	1
steel	1
and	1
after	1
I	1
did	1
break	1
my	1
bow	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
my	1
bow	1
for	1
we	1
did	1
obtain	1
no	1
food	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1619	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
return	1
without	1
food	1
to	1
our	1
families	1
and	1
being	1
much	1
fatigued	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
journeying	1
they	1
did	1
suffer	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1620	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
murmur	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sufferings	1
and	1
afflictions	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
father	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
his	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
murmur	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1621	1
21	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
having	1
been	1
afflicted	1
with	1
my	1
brethren	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
my	1
bow	1
and	1
their	1
bows	1
having	1
lost	1
their	1
springs	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
difficult	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
obtain	1
no	1
food	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1622	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
speak	1
much	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
again	1
even	1
unto	1
complaining	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1623	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
make	1
out	1
of	1
wood	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
straight	1
stick	1
an	1
arrow	1
wherefore	1
I	1
did	1
arm	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
an	1
arrow	1
with	1
a	1
sling	1
and	1
with	1
stones	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
Whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
obtain	1
food	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1624	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
humbled	1
themselves	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
say	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
truly	1
chastened	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
murmuring	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
sorrow	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1626	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Look	1
upon	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1627	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
beheld	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
ball	1
he	1
did	1
fear	1
and	1
tremble	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
our	1
wives	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1628	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
beheld	1
the	1
pointers	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ball	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
work	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
and	1
diligence	1
and	1
heed	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1629	1
29	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
written	1
upon	1
them	1
a	1
new	1
writing	1
which	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
which	1
did	1
give	1
us	1
understanding	1
concerning	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
and	1
changed	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
and	1
diligence	1
which	1
we	1
gave	1
unto	1
it	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
by	1
small	1
means	1
the	1
Lord	1
can	1
bring	1
about	1
great	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1630	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
directions	1
which	1
were	1
given	1
upon	1
the	1
ball	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1631	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
slay	1
wild	1
beasts	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
obtain	1
food	1
for	1
our	1
families	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1632	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
tents	1
bearing	1
the	1
beasts	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
slain	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
obtained	1
food	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
joy	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1633	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
again	1
take	1
our	1
journey	1
traveling	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
course	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
traveled	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
again	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
tarry	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
time	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1634	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
died	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Nahom	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1635	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
did	1
mourn	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
afflictions	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
murmur	1
against	1
my	1
father	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
saying	1
Our	1
father	1
is	1
dead	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
wandered	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
much	1
affliction	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
fatigue	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
sufferings	1
we	1
must	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
hunger	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1636	1
36	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
murmur	1
against	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1637	1
37	1
And	1
Laman	1
said	1
unto	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Behold	1
let	1
us	1
slay	1
our	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
ruler	1
and	1
our	1
teacher	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
elder	1
brethren	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1638	1
38	1
Now	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
angels	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
lies	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
he	1
worketh	1
many	1
things	1
by	1
his	1
cunning	1
arts	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
deceive	1
our	1
eyes	1
thinking	1
perhaps	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
lead	1
us	1
away	1
into	1
some	1
strange	1
wilderness	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
led	1
us	1
away	1
he	1
has	1
thought	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
my	1
brother	1
Laman	1
stir	1
up	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
anger	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1639	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
us	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
speak	1
many	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
chasten	1
them	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
chastened	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
they	1
did	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
anger	1
and	1
did	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
bless	1
us	1
again	1
with	1
food	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
perish	1
1	1
Nephi	1
17	1
Chapter	1
17	1
1	1
Nephi	1
171	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
again	1
take	1
our	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
travel	1
nearly	1
eastward	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
travel	1
and	1
wade	1
through	1
much	1
affliction	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
our	1
women	1
did	1
bear	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
172	1
2	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
upon	1
us	1
that	1
while	1
we	1
did	1
live	1
upon	1
raw	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
our	1
women	1
did	1
give	1
plenty	1
of	1
suck	1
for	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
were	1
strong	1
yea	1
even	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
bear	1
their	1
journeyings	1
without	1
murmurings	1
1	1
Nephi	1
173	1
3	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
doth	1
nourish	1
them	1
and	1
strengthen	1
them	1
and	1
provide	1
means	1
whereby	1
they	1
can	1
accomplish	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
commanded	1
them	1
wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
provide	1
means	1
for	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
did	1
sojourn	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
174	1
4	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
sojourn	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
yea	1
even	1
eight	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
175	1
5	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
we	1
called	1
Bountiful	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
much	1
fruit	1
and	1
also	1
wild	1
honey	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
prepared	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
perish	1
And	1
we	1
beheld	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
we	1
called	1
Irreantum	1
which	1
being	1
interpreted	1
is	1
many	1
waters	1
1	1
Nephi	1
176	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
many	1
afflictions	1
and	1
much	1
difficulty	1
yea	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
write	1
them	1
all	1
we	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
rejoiced	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
we	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
Bountiful	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
much	1
fruit	1
1	1
Nephi	1
177	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Bountiful	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Arise	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
mountain	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mountain	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
178	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
construct	1
a	1
ship	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
thee	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
carry	1
thy	1
people	1
across	1
these	1
waters	1
1	1
Nephi	1
179	1
9	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
Lord	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
ore	1
to	1
molten	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
tools	1
to	1
construct	1
the	1
ship	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1710	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
told	1
me	1
whither	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
find	1
ore	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
tools	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
make	1
a	1
bellows	1
wherewith	1
to	1
blow	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
beasts	1
and	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
bellows	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
wherewith	1
to	1
blow	1
the	1
fire	1
I	1
did	1
smite	1
two	1
stones	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
fire	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1712	1
12	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
not	1
hitherto	1
suffered	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
make	1
much	1
fire	1
as	1
we	1
journeyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
food	1
become	1
sweet	1
that	1
ye	1
cook	1
it	1
not	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1713	1
13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
be	1
your	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
you	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
wherefore	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
towards	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
led	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1714	1
14	1
Yea	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
also	1
that	1
After	1
ye	1
have	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
am	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
destruction	1
yea	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1715	1
15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
strive	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
exhort	1
my	1
brethren	1
to	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
diligence	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
make	1
tools	1
of	1
the	1
ore	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
molten	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1717	1
17	1
And	1
when	1
my	1
brethren	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
ship	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
against	1
me	1
saying	1
Our	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
fool	1
for	1
he	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
build	1
a	1
ship	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
cross	1
these	1
great	1
waters	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1718	1
18	1
And	1
thus	1
my	1
brethren	1
did	1
complain	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
labor	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
build	1
a	1
ship	1
neither	1
would	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
instructed	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1719	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
rejoice	1
over	1
me	1
saying	1
We	1
knew	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
construct	1
a	1
ship	1
for	1
we	1
knew	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
lacking	1
in	1
judgment	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
accomplish	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
work	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1720	1
20	1
And	1
thou	1
art	1
like	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
foolish	1
imaginations	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
yea	1
he	1
hath	1
led	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
our	1
women	1
have	1
toiled	1
being	1
big	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
borne	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
suffered	1
all	1
things	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
death	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
died	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
these	1
afflictions	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1721	1
21	1
Behold	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
time	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
our	1
possessions	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1722	1
22	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
were	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
commandments	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
wherefore	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
and	1
our	1
father	1
hath	1
judged	1
them	1
and	1
hath	1
led	1
us	1
away	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
words	1
yea	1
and	1
our	1
brother	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
him	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
language	1
did	1
my	1
brethren	1
murmur	1
and	1
complain	1
against	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1723	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Do	1
ye	1
believe	1
that	1
our	1
fathers	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1724	1
24	1
Yea	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
not	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1725	1
25	1
Now	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
laden	1
with	1
tasks	1
which	1
were	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1726	1
26	1
Now	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
Moses	1
was	1
commanded	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
great	1
work	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
word	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
were	1
divided	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
and	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1727	1
27	1
But	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1728	1
28	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fed	1
with	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1729	1
29	1
Yea	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
Moses	1
by	1
his	1
word	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
smote	1
the	1
rock	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
forth	1
water	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
might	1
quench	1
their	1
thirst	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1730	1
30	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
being	1
led	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
going	1
before	1
them	1
leading	1
them	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
giving	1
light	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
doing	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
expedient	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
receive	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
blinded	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
reviled	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1731	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
did	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
did	1
lead	1
them	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
done	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
his	1
word	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1732	1
32	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
river	1
Jordan	1
he	1
did	1
make	1
them	1
mighty	1
unto	1
the	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
unto	1
the	1
scattering	1
them	1
to	1
destruction	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1733	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
who	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
righteous	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1734	1
34	1
Do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
choice	1
than	1
they	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
righteous	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1735	1
35	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
esteemeth	1
all	1
flesh	1
in	1
one	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous	1
is	1
favored	1
of	1
God	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
people	1
had	1
rejected	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
ripe	1
in	1
iniquity	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
curse	1
the	1
land	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
bless	1
it	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
curse	1
it	1
against	1
them	1
unto	1
their	1
destruction	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
bless	1
it	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
unto	1
their	1
obtaining	1
power	1
over	1
it	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1736	1
36	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
created	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
inhabited	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
created	1
his	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
possess	1
it	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1737	1
37	1
And	1
he	1
raiseth	1
up	1
a	1
righteous	1
nation	1
and	1
destroyeth	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1738	1
38	1
And	1
he	1
leadeth	1
away	1
the	1
righteous	1
into	1
precious	1
lands	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
he	1
destroyeth	1
and	1
curseth	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1739	1
39	1
He	1
ruleth	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
throne	1
and	1
this	1
earth	1
is	1
his	1
footstool	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1740	1
40	1
And	1
he	1
loveth	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
have	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
God	1
Behold	1
he	1
loved	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
he	1
covenanted	1
with	1
them	1
yea	1
even	1
Abraham	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
covenants	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1741	1
41	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
straiten	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
his	1
rod	1
for	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
straitened	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
He	1
sent	1
fiery	1
flying	1
serpents	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
bitten	1
he	1
prepared	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
healed	1
and	1
the	1
labor	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
perform	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
simpleness	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
or	1
the	1
easiness	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
perished	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1742	1
42	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
revile	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
also	1
against	1
God	1
nevertheless	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
forth	1
by	1
his	1
matchless	1
power	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1743	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
wicked	1
yea	1
nearly	1
unto	1
ripeness	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
day	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
must	1
surely	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
destroyed	1
save	1
a	1
few	1
only	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
into	1
captivity	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1744	1
44	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
life	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
life	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
murderers	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1745	1
45	1
Ye	1
are	1
swift	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
but	1
slow	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
small	1
voice	1
but	1
ye	1
were	1
past	1
feeling	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
his	1
words	1
wherefore	1
he	1
has	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder	1
which	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
shake	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
divide	1
asunder	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1746	1
46	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
almighty	1
word	1
he	1
can	1
cause	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
can	1
cause	1
the	1
rough	1
places	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
smooth	1
and	1
smooth	1
places	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
O	1
then	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
hard	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1747	1
47	1
Behold	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
rent	1
with	1
anguish	1
because	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
pained	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
forever	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
insomuch	1
that	1
my	1
frame	1
has	1
no	1
strength	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1748	1
48	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
throw	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
touch	1
me	1
not	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
consuming	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
whoso	1
shall	1
lay	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
shall	1
wither	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
dried	1
reed	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
naught	1
before	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
him	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1749	1
49	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
murmur	1
no	1
more	1
against	1
their	1
father	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
withhold	1
their	1
labor	1
from	1
me	1
for	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
a	1
ship	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1750	1
50	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
If	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
them	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
command	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
water	1
be	1
thou	1
earth	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
earth	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
it	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1751	1
51	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
has	1
wrought	1
so	1
many	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
instruct	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
a	1
ship	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1752	1
52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
said	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
confounded	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
contend	1
against	1
me	1
neither	1
durst	1
they	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
nor	1
touch	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
fingers	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
Now	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
wither	1
before	1
me	1
so	1
powerful	1
was	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
had	1
wrought	1
upon	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1753	1
53	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
again	1
unto	1
thy	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
wither	1
before	1
thee	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
shock	1
them	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1754	1
54	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
stretched	1
forth	1
my	1
hand	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
wither	1
before	1
me	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
shake	1
them	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1755	1
55	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
said	1
We	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
has	1
shaken	1
us	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
worship	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
saying	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
brother	1
yea	1
even	1
thy	1
younger	1
brother	1
wherefore	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
and	1
honor	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1

Nephi	1

Chapter	1
18	1
1	1
Nephi	1
181	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
work	1
timbers	1
of	1
curious	1
workmanship	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
show	1
me	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
after	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
should	1
work	1
the	1
timbers	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
1	1
Nephi	1
182	1
2	1
Now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
not	1
work	1
the	1
timbers	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
was	1
learned	1
by	1
men	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
build	1
the	1
ship	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
build	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
wherefore	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
183	1
3	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
oft	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
pray	1
oft	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
showed	1
unto	1
me	1
great	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
184	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
ship	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
my	1
brethren	1
beheld	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
workmanship	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fine	1
wherefore	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
185	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
arise	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
1	1
Nephi	1
186	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
prepared	1
all	1
things	1
much	1
fruits	1
and	1
meat	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
honey	1
in	1
abundance	1
and	1
provisions	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
us	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
loading	1
and	1
our	1
seeds	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
we	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
us	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
age	1
wherefore	1
we	1
did	1
all	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
1	1
Nephi	1
187	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
begat	1
two	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
the	1
elder	1
was	1
called	1
Jacob	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
Joseph	1
1	1
Nephi	1
188	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
us	1
our	1
provisions	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
commanded	1
us	1
we	1
did	1
put	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
towards	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
1	1
Nephi	1
189	1
9	1
And	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
forth	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
wives	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
themselves	1
merry	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
to	1
sing	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
much	1
rudeness	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
forget	1
by	1
what	1
power	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
thither	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
unto	1
exceeding	1
rudeness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1810	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
exceedingly	1
lest	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
smite	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
iniquity	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
wherefore	1
I	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
much	1
soberness	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
saying	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
that	1
our	1
younger	1
brother	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
us	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1811	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
did	1
take	1
me	1
and	1
bind	1
me	1
with	1
cords	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
treat	1
me	1
with	1
much	1
harshness	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
suffer	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
wicked	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1812	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
bound	1
me	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
the	1
compass	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
cease	1
to	1
work	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1813	1
13	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
they	1
should	1
steer	1
the	1
ship	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
yea	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
tempest	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
exceedingly	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
loose	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1814	1
14	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
back	1
the	1
tempest	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1815	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
And	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
days	1
my	1
brethren	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
were	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
perish	1
save	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
wherefore	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
loosed	1
the	1
bands	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
my	1
wrist	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
swollen	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
also	1
mine	1
ankles	1
were	1
much	1
swollen	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
soreness	1
thereof	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1816	1
16	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
did	1
look	1
unto	1
my	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
praise	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
murmur	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1817	1
17	1
Now	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
had	1
said	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
breathe	1
out	1
much	1
threatenings	1
against	1
anyone	1
that	1
should	1
speak	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
parents	1
being	1
stricken	1
in	1
years	1
and	1
having	1
suffered	1
much	1
grief	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
down	1
yea	1
even	1
upon	1
their	1
sickbeds	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1818	1
18	1
Because	1
of	1
their	1
grief	1
and	1
much	1
sorrow	1
and	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
near	1
even	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
meet	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
their	1
grey	1
hairs	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
lie	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
yea	1
even	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
with	1
sorrow	1
into	1
a	1
watery	1
grave	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1819	1
19	1
And	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Joseph	1
also	1
being	1
young	1
having	1
need	1
of	1
much	1
nourishment	1
were	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
wife	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
prayers	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
children	1
did	1
not	1
soften	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
loose	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1820	1
20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
threatened	1
them	1
with	1
destruction	1
could	1
soften	1
their	1
hearts	1
wherefore	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
they	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
loosed	1
me	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1821	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
loosed	1
me	1
behold	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
compass	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
work	1
whither	1
I	1
desired	1
it	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
prayed	1
the	1
winds	1
did	1
cease	1
and	1
the	1
storm	1
did	1
cease	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1822	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
guide	1
the	1
ship	1
that	1
we	1
sailed	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1823	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
we	1
did	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
call	1
it	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1824	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
plant	1
seeds	1
yea	1
we	1
did	1
put	1
all	1
our	1
seeds	1
into	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
grow	1
exceedingly	1
wherefore	1
we	1
were	1
blessed	1
in	1
abundance	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1825	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1

find	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1

as	1
we	1
journeyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
beasts	1
in	1

of	1
every	1
kind	1

the	1

and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wild	1
animals	1
which	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
men	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
find	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
ore	1

of	1
gold	1

of	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
me	1
wherefore	1
I	1
did	1
make	1
plates	1
of	1
ore	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
engraven	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
I	1
did	1
engraven	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
journeyings	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
prophecies	1
have	1
I	1
engraven	1
upon	1
them	1
1	1
Nephi	1
192	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
made	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
commanded	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
plates	1
wherefore	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
proceedings	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
are	1
engraven	1
upon	1
those	1
first	1
plates	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
transpired	1
before	1
I	1
made	1
these	1
plates	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
more	1
particularly	1
made	1
mention	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
plates	1
1	1
Nephi	1
193	1
3	1
And	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
these	1
plates	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
commandment	1
I	1
Nephi	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
that	1
the	1
ministry	1
and	1
the	1
prophecies	1
the	1
more	1
plain	1
and	1
precious	1
parts	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
should	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
other	1
wise	1
purposes	1
which	1
purposes	1
are	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
194	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
plates	1
which	1
gives	1
an	1
account	1
or	1
which	1
gives	1
a	1
greater	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
and	1
destructions	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
And	1
this	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
and	1
commanded	1
my	1
people	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
after	1
I	1
was	1
gone	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
plates	1
should	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
one	1
generation	1
to	1
another	1
or	1
from	1
one	1
prophet	1
to	1
another	1
until	1
further	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
1	1
Nephi	1
195	1
5	1
And	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
making	1
these	1
plates	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
hereafter	1
and	1
then	1
behold	1
I	1
proceed	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
sacred	1
things	1
may	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
196	1
6	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
anything	1
upon	1
plates	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
be	1
sacred	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
err	1
even	1
did	1
they	1
err	1
of	1
old	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
excuse	1
myself	1
because	1
of	1
other	1
men	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
weakness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
would	1
excuse	1
myself	1
1	1
Nephi	1
197	1
7	1
For	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
some	1
men	1
esteem	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
soul	1
others	1
set	1
at	1
naught	1
and	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
Yea	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
do	1
men	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
I	1
say	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
in	1
other	1
wordsthey	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
naught	1
and	1
hearken	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
counsels	1
1	1
Nephi	1
198	1
8	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
cometh	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
in	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
my	1
father	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
1	1
Nephi	1
199	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
judge	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
naught	1
wherefore	1
they	1
scourge	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
suffereth	1
it	1
and	1
they	1
smite	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
suffereth	1
it	1
Yea	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
suffereth	1
it	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
loving	1
kindness	1
and	1
his	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1910	1
10	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
who	1
were	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
and	1
also	1
were	1
preserved	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
him	1
yea	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
of	1
Isaac	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
yieldeth	1
himself	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
wicked	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Zenock	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
crucified	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Neum	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Zenos	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
of	1
darkness	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
should	1
inhabit	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
more	1
especially	1
given	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1911	1
11	1
For	1
thus	1
spake	1
the	1
prophet	1
The	1
Lord	1
God	1
surely	1
shall	1
visit	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
some	1
with	1
his	1
voice	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
their	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
salvation	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
the	1
thunderings	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
by	1
tempest	1
by	1
fire	1
and	1
by	1
smoke	1
and	1
vapor	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
by	1
mountains	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
up	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1912	1
12	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
surely	1
come	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
And	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
must	1
rend	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
groanings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
be	1
wrought	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
exclaim	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
nature	1
suffers	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1913	1
13	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
scourged	1
by	1
all	1
people	1
because	1
they	1
crucify	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
turn	1
their	1
hearts	1
aside	1
rejecting	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1914	1
14	1
And	1
because	1
they	1
turn	1
their	1
hearts	1
aside	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
and	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
perish	1
and	1
become	1
a	1
hiss	1
and	1
a	1
byword	1
and	1
be	1
hated	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1915	1
15	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
that	1
day	1
cometh	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
they	1
no	1
more	1
turn	1
aside	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
then	1
will	1
he	1
remember	1
the	1
covenants	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
to	1
their	1
fathers	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1916	1
16	1
Yea	1
then	1
will	1
he	1
remember	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
in	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1917	1
17	1
Yea	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1918	1
18	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
have	1
written	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
persuade	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1919	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
obtain	1
these	1
things	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1920	1
20	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
workings	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
doth	1
weary	1
me	1
even	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
joints	1
are	1
weak	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
been	1
merciful	1
to	1
show	1
unto	1
me	1
concerning	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
prophets	1
of	1
old	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
perished	1
also	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1921	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
surely	1
did	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
old	1
all	1
things	1
concerning	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
he	1
did	1
show	1
unto	1
many	1
concerning	1
us	1
wherefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
concerning	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1922	1
22	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
teach	1
my	1
brethren	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
read	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
other	1
lands	1
among	1
people	1
of	1
old	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1923	1
23	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
read	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
Moses	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
more	1
fully	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
I	1
did	1
read	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Isaiah	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
liken	1
all	1
scriptures	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
our	1
profit	1
and	1
learning	1
1	1
Nephi	1
1924	1
24	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
ye	1
who	1
are	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
branch	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
off	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
liken	1
them	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
hope	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
your	1
brethren	1
from	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
off	1
for	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
has	1
the	1
prophet	1
written	1
1	1
Nephi	1
20	1
Chapter	1
20	1
1	1
Nephi	1
201	1
1	1
Hearken	1
and	1
hear	1
this	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Judah	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
baptism	1
who	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
yet	1
they	1
swear	1
not	1
in	1
truth	1
nor	1
in	1
righteousness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
202	1
2	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
call	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
but	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
stay	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
yea	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
1	1
Nephi	1
203	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1

they	1

bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1

towards	1
the	1

and	1
lick	1
up	1
the	1

thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1

they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
me	1

Nephi	1
2124	1
24	1
For	1
shall	1
the	1
prey	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
mighty	1
or	1
the	1
lawful	1
captives	1
delivered	1
1	1

2125	1
25	1
But	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
even	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
contendeth	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thy	1
children	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2126	1
26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
that	1
oppress	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
flesh	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
drunken	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
blood	1
as	1
with	1
sweet	1
wine	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1

am	1
thy	1

thy	1

Chapter	1

221	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
read	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
my	1
brethren	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
What	1
meaneth	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
read	1
Behold	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
according	1
to	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
flesh	1
1	1
Nephi	1
222	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
they	1
were	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
are	1
all	1
things	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
1	1
Nephi	1
223	1
3	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
are	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
things	1
both	1
temporal	1
and	1
spiritual	1
for	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
will	1
be	1
scattered	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
also	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
1	1
Nephi	1
224	1
4	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
are	1
already	1
lost	1
from	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Yea	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
away	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
scattered	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
upon	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
whither	1
they	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
knoweth	1
save	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
away	1
1	1
Nephi	1
225	1
5	1
And	1
since	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
away	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
been	1
prophesied	1
concerning	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
be	1
scattered	1
and	1
be	1
confounded	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
against	1
him	1
will	1
they	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
wherefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
1	1
Nephi	1
226	1
6	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
nursed	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
standard	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
spoken	1
are	1
temporal	1
for	1
thus	1
are	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
it	1
meaneth	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
our	1
brethren	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
227	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
meaneth	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
been	1
scattered	1
and	1
confounded	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
mighty	1
nation	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
yea	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
by	1
them	1
shall	1
our	1
seed	1
be	1
scattered	1
1	1
Nephi	1
228	1
8	1
And	1
after	1
our	1
seed	1
is	1
scattered	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
our	1
seed	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
likened	1
unto	1
their	1
being	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
being	1
carried	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
1	1
Nephi	1
229	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
be	1
of	1
worth	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
but	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
the	1
making	1
known	1
of	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1

unto	1
Abraham	1
saying	1
In	1
thy	1

be	1
blessed	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2210	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
cannot	1
be	1
blessed	1
unless	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
bare	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2211	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
make	1
bare	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
in	1
bringing	1
about	1
his	1

his	1
gospel	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2212	1
12	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
captivity	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
obscurity	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
their	1
Savior	1
and	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
the	1
Mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2213	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
whore	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
turn	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1

for	1
they	1
shall	1
war	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
their	1

shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
their	1

they	1
shall	1
be	1
drunken	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
blood	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2214	1
14	1
And	1
every	1
nation	1
which	1
shall	1
war	1
against	1
thee	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
which	1
they	1
digged	1
to	1
ensnare	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
that	1
great	1
whore	1
who	1
hath	1
perverted	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
abominable	1
church	1
shall	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1

great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1

1	1
Nephi	1
2215	1
15	1
For	1
behold	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
speedily	1
that	1
Satan	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
soon	1
cometh	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
proud	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
do	1
wickedly	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
stubble	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
burned	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2216	1
16	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
soon	1
cometh	1
that	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
righteous	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2217	1
17	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
will	1
preserve	1
the	1
righteous	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
the	1
righteous	1
be	1
preserved	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
by	1
fire	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
righteous	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
as	1
by	1
fire	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2218	1
18	1
Behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
yea	1
even	1
blood	1
and	1
fire	1
and	1
vapor	1
of	1
smoke	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
earth	1
and	1
it	1
cometh	1
unto	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2219	1
19	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
surely	1
must	1
come	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
who	1
fight	1
against	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2220	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
surely	1
prepare	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Moses	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
saying	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
like	1
unto	1
me	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
prophet	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2221	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
prophet	1
of	1
whom	1
Moses	1
spake	1
was	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
wherefore	1
he	1
shall	1
execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
righteousness	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2222	1
22	1
And	1
the	1
righteous	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
confounded	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
which	1
kingdom	1
is	1
established	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2223	1
23	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
speedily	1
shall	1
come	1
that	1
all	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
to	1
get	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
to	1
become	1
popular	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
yea	1
in	1
fine	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
need	1
fear	1
and	1
tremble	1
and	1
quake	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
consumed	1
as	1
stubble	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2224	1
24	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
speedily	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
must	1
be	1
led	1
up	1
as	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
stall	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
must	1
reign	1
in	1
dominion	1
and	1
might	1
and	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2225	1
25	1
And	1
he	1
gathereth	1
his	1
children	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
he	1
numbereth	1
his	1
sheep	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
him	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
feed	1
his	1
sheep	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
pasture	1
1	1
Nephi	1
2226	1
26	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1

he	1
cannot	1
be	1
loosed	1
for	1

he	1

Nephi	1
2227	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
Nephi	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
come	1
according	1
to	1

Nephi	1

But	1
behold	1
all	1
nations	1

and	1

shall	1

Nephi	1
2229	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
for	1
I	1
durst	1
not	1
speak	1
further	1

concerning	1

Wherefore	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
they	1
testify	1
that	1
a	1

be	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
1	1

Wherefore	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1

I	1

the	1
only	1
ones	1
that	1
have	1

Wherefore	1
if	1

endure	1

the	1

now	1
it	1

to	1

that	1
after	1
I	1

had	1
made	1
an	1

of	1
teaching	1
my	1

our	1

And	1
he	1

unto	1

concerning	1

upon	1
the	1

the	1

he	1
also	1

unto	1

concerning	1
the	1

of	1
promise	1
which	1
they	1
had	1

For	1
behold	1
said	1

I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1

destroyed	1

had	1
we	1

in	1

we	1
should	1

have	1

Nephi	1

But	1
said	1
he	1
notwithstanding	1
our	1
afflictions	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1

hath	1

with	1
me	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
land	1
for	1
the	1

of	1
my	1

Yea	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
covenanted	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
me	1

to	1
my	1
children	1
forever	1

also	1
all	1
those	1

countries	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1

Wherefore	1
I	1
Lehi	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
none	1
come	1
into	1

they	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
17	1

Wherefore	1
this	1

is	1
consecrated	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
liberty	1
unto	1
them	1
wherefore	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
into	1
captivity	1
if	1
so	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
for	1
if	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
abound	1
cursed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1

it	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1

2	1
Nephi	1
18	1

And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
wisdom	1
that	1
this	1
land	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
as	1
yet	1
from	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
for	1
behold	1
many	1
nations	1
would	1
overrun	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
2	1

19	1

Wherefore	1
I	1
Lehi	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
promise	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
those	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
they	1
shall	1
prosper	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
nations	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
possess	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
themselves	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
molest	1
them	1
nor	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1

they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely	1

But	1
behold	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
dwindle	1
in	1

great	1
blessings	1

that	1

would	1
awake	1
awake	1
from	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
yea	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
sleep	1
of	1

shake	1
off	1
the	1
awful	1
chains	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
bound	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
chains	1
which	1
bind	1

Awake	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1

dust	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
trembling	1
parent	1
whose	1
limbs	1
ye	1
must	1
soon	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1

silent	1
grave	1
from	1
whence	1
no	1
traveler	1
can	1
return	1

But	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
hell	1
I	1
have	1
beheld	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
encircled	1
about	1
eternally	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
2	1
Nephi	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
behold	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
the	1
anxiety	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
2	1
Nephi	1
117	1
17	1
My	1
heart	1
hath	1
been	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
sorrow	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
feared	1
lest	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
upon	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
destroyed	1
forever	1
2	1
Nephi	1
118	1
18	1
Or	1
that	1
a	1
cursing	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
generations	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
visited	1
by	1
sword	1
and	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
are	1
hated	1
and	1
are	1
led	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
2	1
Nephi	1
119	1
19	1
O	1
my	1
sons	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
choice	1
and	1
a	1
favored	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
But	1
behold	1
his	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
his	1
ways	1
are	1
righteousness	1
forever	1
2	1
Nephi	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1

inasmuch	1

And	1
now	1
that	1

in	1
you	1

that	1
my	1
heart	1
might	1
leave	1

again	1

ye	1
have	1
accused	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
power	1

authority	1
over	1
you	1

I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
sought	1
for	1

hath	1
used	1
sharpness	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
angry	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
behold	1
his	1
sharpness	1
was	1
the	1
sharpness	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
call	1
anger	1
was	1
the	1
truth	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
manifesting	1
boldly	1
concerning	1
your	1
iniquities	1
2	1
Nephi	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
must	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
even	1
unto	1
his	1
commanding	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
obey	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
utterance	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
shut	1
it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
128	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
Laman	1
and	1
also	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
Sam	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
sons	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Nephi	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
leave	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
blessing	1
yea	1
even	1
my	1
first	1
blessing	1
2	1
Nephi	1
129	1
29	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
first	1

yea	1
even	1
my	1
blessing	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
him	1
2	1
Nephi	1
130	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
Zoram	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
Behold	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Laban	1
nevertheless	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

I	1

that	1
thou	1

unto	1
my	1

Nephi	1
131	1
31	1
Wherefore	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
with	1
his	1
seed	1
that	1
they	1
dwell	1
in	1
prosperity	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1
this	1

and	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
iniquity	1

Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
consecrated	1
this	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
Jacob	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
tribulation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
behold	1
in	1
thy	1
childhood	1
thou	1
hast	1
suffered	1
afflictions	1
and	1
much	1
sorrow	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
rudeness	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
2	1
Nephi	1
22	1
2	1
Nevertheless	1
Jacob	1
my	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
thine	1
afflictions	1
for	1
thy	1
gain	1
2	1
Nephi	1
23	1
3	1
Wherefore	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
safely	1
with	1
thy	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
and	1
thy	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
thy	1
God	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
redeemed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
thy	1
Redeemer	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
beheld	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
bring	1
salvation	1
unto	1
men	1
2	1
Nephi	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
beheld	1
in	1
thy	1
youth	1
his	1
glory	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
blessed	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
unto	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
salvation	1
is	1
free	1
2	1
Nephi	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
men	1
are	1
instructed	1
sufficiently	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
And	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
men	1
And	1
by	1
the	1

no	1
flesh	1
is	1
justified	1

by	1
the	1

men	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
Yea	1
by	1
the	1
temporal	1
law	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
spiritual	1

they	1
perish	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1

become	1

forever	1
2	1
Nephi	1
26	1

Wherefore	1
redemption	1
cometh	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
Holy	1

for	1
he	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
truth	1
2	1
Nephi	1
27	1
7	1
Behold	1
he	1
offereth	1
himself	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sin	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
broken	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit	1
and	1
unto	1
none	1
else	1
can	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
be	1
answered	1
2	1
Nephi	1
28	1
8	1
Wherefore	1
how	1
great	1
the	1
importance	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
they	1
may	1

that	1
there	1

through	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Messiah	1
who	1
layeth	1
down	1

taketh	1
it	1
again	1
by	1
the	1

the	1

that	1
he	1
may	1
bring	1
to	1

the	1

that	1

Wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
unto	1
God	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
believe	1

shall	1
be	1
saved	1
2	1
Nephi	1
210	1
10	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
intercession	1
for	1
all	1
all	1
men	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
wherefore	1
they	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
holiness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
inflicting	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
which	1
is	1
affixed	1
which	1
punishment	1
that	1
is	1
affixed	1
is	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
answer	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
atonement	1
2	1
Nephi	1
211	1
11	1
For	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
opposition	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
If	1
not	1
so	1
my	1

neither	1

neither	1

neither	1

Wherefore	1
all	1

must	1

be	1
a	1
compound	1
in	1
one	1
wherefore	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
one	1

it	1
must	1

neither	1

neither	1

2	1
Nephi	1
212	1

Wherefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
created	1
for	1
a	1

of	1
naught	1
wherefore	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1

Wherefore	1
this	1

destroy	1
the	1

And	1
if	1

And	1
now	1
my	1

I	1

unto	1
you	1
these	1

for	1
your	1

for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1

both	1
the	1

the	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
in	1

are	1
both	1

things	1
to	1
be	1

2	1
Nephi	1

And	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
his	1
eternal	1
purposes	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1

after	1
he	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
in	1
fine	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
created	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
opposition	1
even	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1

one	1
being	1
sweet	1

the	1
other	1
bitter	1
2	1
Nephi	1
216	1
16	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
act	1
for	1
himself	1
Wherefore	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
act	1
for	1
himself	1
save	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
enticed	1
by	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
2	1
Nephi	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
Lehi	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
must	1
needs	1
suppose	1
that	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
heaven	1
wherefore	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
devil	1
having	1
sought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
before	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
218	1
18	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
heaven	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
miserable	1
forever	1
he	1
sought	1
also	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Eve	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
old	1
serpent	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
lies	1
wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
Partake	1
of	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
die	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
God	1
knowing	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
2	1
Nephi	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
after	1
Adam	1
and	1
Eve	1
had	1
partaken	1
of	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
2	1
Nephi	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
forth	1
children	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
2	1
Nephi	1
221	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
were	1
prolonged	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
repent	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
wherefore	1
their	1
state	1
became	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
probation	1
and	1
their	1
time	1
was	1
lengthened	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
For	1
he	1
gave	1
commandment	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
must	1
repent	1
for	1
he	1
showed	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
their	1
parents	1
2	1
Nephi	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
Adam	1
had	1
not	1
transgressed	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
fallen	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
created	1
must	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
created	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
remained	1
forever	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
end	1
2	1
Nephi	1
223	1
23	1
And	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
children	1
wherefore	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
innocence	1
having	1
no	1
joy	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
no	1

doing	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
no	1

2	1

But	1
behold	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
been	1

him	1
who	1
knoweth	1

Nephi	1
225	1
25	1
Adam	1
fell	1
that	1
men	1

men	1
are	1
that	1
they	1

joy	1
2	1
Nephi	1

And	1
the	1
Messiah	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
redeem	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
fall	1
And	1
because	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
fall	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
free	1
forever	1
knowing	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
to	1
act	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
acted	1
upon	1

it	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
2	1
Nephi	1
227	1
27	1
Wherefore	1
men	1
are	1
free	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
given	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
expedient	1
unto	1
man	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
choose	1
liberty	1
and	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
great	1
Mediator	1
of	1
all	1
men	1

to	1
choose	1
captivity	1
and	1
death	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
captivity	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
he	1
seeketh	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
might	1
be	1

2	1
Nephi	1
228	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
sons	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
Mediator	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
great	1
commandments	1

be	1
faithful	1
unto	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
choose	1
eternal	1

according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
2	1
Nephi	1
229	1
29	1
And	1
not	1
choose	1
eternal	1
death	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
is	1
therein	1
which	1
giveth	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1

power	1
to	1
captivate	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
down	1

you	1

I	1
have	1
spoken	1
these	1

words	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
probation	1

I	1
have	1
chosen	1
the	1
good	1
part	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
none	1
other	1
object	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
everlasting	1
welfare	1
of	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
Joseph	1
my	1
lastborn	1
Thou	1
wast	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
greatest	1
sorrow	1
did	1
thy	1
mother	1
bear	1
thee	1
2	1
Nephi	1
32	1
2	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
consecrate	1
also	1
unto	1
thee	1
this	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
precious	1
land	1
for	1
thine	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
with	1
thy	1
brethren	1
for	1
thy	1
security	1
forever	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
33	1

And	1
now	1
Joseph	1
my	1
lastborn	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
thee	1
forever	1
for	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
not	1
utterly	1
be	1
destroyed	1

Nephi	1
34	1

For	1
behold	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
loins	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Joseph	1
who	1
was	1
carried	1
captive	1
into	1
Egypt	1
And	1
great	1
were	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
unto	1
Joseph	1
2	1
Nephi	1
35	1
5	1
Wherefore	1
Joseph	1
truly	1
saw	1
our	1
day	1
And	1
he	1
obtained	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
righteous	1
branch	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
not	1
the	1
Messiah	1
but	1
a	1
branch	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
off	1
nevertheless	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
in	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
the	1
Messiah	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
bringing	1
of	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
unto	1
lightyea	1
out	1
of	1
hidden	1
darkness	1
and	1
out	1
of	1

unto	1
freedom	1

For	1
Joseph	1
truly	1
testified	1

A	1
seer	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
my	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1

seer	1
unto	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
loins	1
2	1
Nephi	1
37	1
7	1
Yea	1
Joseph	1
truly	1
said	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
me	1
A	1
choice	1
seer	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
highly	1
among	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
commandment	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
a	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
his	1
brethren	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
them	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
bringing	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
covenants	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
thy	1
fathers	1
2	1
Nephi	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
commandment	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
none	1
other	1
work	1
save	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
command	1
him	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
great	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
work	1
2	1
Nephi	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
like	1
unto	1
Moses	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
deliver	1
my	1
people	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
Moses	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
to	1
deliver	1
thy	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
2	1
Nephi	1
311	1
11	1
But	1
a	1
seer	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
unto	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
power	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
word	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
loinsand	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
bringing	1
forth	1
my	1
word	1
only	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
convincing	1
them	1
of	1
my	1
word	1
which	1
shall	1
have	1
already	1
gone	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
312	1
12	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
shall	1
write	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
write	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
grow	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
confounding	1
of	1
false	1
doctrines	1
and	1
laying	1
down	1
of	1
contentions	1
and	1
establishing	1
peace	1
among	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
bringing	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
covenants	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
weakness	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
strong	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
work	1
shall	1
commence	1
among	1
all	1
my	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
restoring	1
thee	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
314	1
14	1
And	1
thus	1
prophesied	1
Joseph	1
saying	1
Behold	1
that	1
seer	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded	1
for	1
this	1
promise	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
obtained	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
loins	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
this	1
promise	1
2	1
Nephi	1
315	1
15	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
bring	1
my	1
people	1
unto	1
salvation	1
2	1
Nephi	1
316	1
16	1
Yea	1
thus	1
prophesied	1
Joseph	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
thy	1
seed	1
forever	1
2	1
Nephi	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
Moses	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
power	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
rod	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
judgment	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
writing	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
loose	1
his	1
tongue	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
much	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
mighty	1
in	1
speaking	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
unto	1
him	1
my	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
hand	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
spokesman	1
for	1
him	1
2	1
Nephi	1
318	1
18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
also	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
spokesman	1
And	1
I	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
write	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
unto	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
the	1
spokesman	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
shall	1
declare	1
it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
319	1
19	1
And	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
write	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
expedient	1
in	1
my	1
wisdom	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
had	1
cried	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
faith	1
2	1
Nephi	1
320	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
yea	1
even	1
repentance	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
even	1
after	1
many	1
generations	1
have	1
gone	1
by	1
them	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
their	1
cry	1
shall	1
go	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
simpleness	1
of	1
their	1
words	1
2	1
Nephi	1
321	1
21	1
Because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
their	1
words	1
shall	1
proceed	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
loins	1
and	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
their	1
words	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
strong	1
in	1
their	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
remembering	1
of	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers	1
2	1
Nephi	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
Joseph	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
of	1
old	1
prophesy	1
2	1
Nephi	1
323	1
23	1
Wherefore	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
covenant	1
thou	1
art	1
blessed	1
for	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
2	1
Nephi	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
one	1
mighty	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
do	1
much	1
good	1
both	1
in	1
word	1
and	1
in	1
deed	1
being	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
to	1
work	1
mighty	1
wonders	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
bringing	1
to	1
pass	1
much	1
restoration	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
2	1
Nephi	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Joseph	1
Behold	1
thou	1
art	1
little	1
wherefore	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
thee	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
Remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
speak	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
which	1
my	1

hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
Joseph	1
who	1
was	1
carried	1
into	1
Egypt	1
2	1
Nephi	1
42	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
truly	1
prophesied	1
concerning	1
all	1
his	1
seed	1
And	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
greater	1
And	1
he	1
prophesied	1
concerning	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
future	1
generations	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1

Wherefore	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Joseph	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Laman	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
my	1
firstborn	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
2	1
Nephi	1
44	1
4	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
my	1

2	1
Nephi	1
45	1

But	1
behold	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
grave	1
save	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
a	1
blessing	1
upon	1
you	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
46	1

Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
cursed	1
behold	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
blessing	1
upon	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
cursing	1
may	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
be	1
answered	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
2	1
Nephi	1
47	1
7	1
Wherefore	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
blessing	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
perish	1
wherefore	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
unto	1
your	1

And	1
it	1

an	1

of	1

he	1

And	1
he	1

behold	1
I	1

blessing	1
which	1
I	1
left	1
unto	1
the	1

wherefore	1
thou	1

in	1
the	1

thy	1

shall	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
when	1
my	1

had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1

behold	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
Ishmael	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
2	1

11	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Sam	1
saying	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
thou	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
like	1
unto	1
thy	1

Nephi	1
And	1
thy	1

thou	1

2	1
Nephi	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
Lehi	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1

and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
waxed	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
he	1
died	1

was	1
buried	1
2	1
Nephi	1
413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
admonitions	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
414	1
14	1
For	1
I	1
Nephi	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
spoken	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
my	1

before	1
his	1

many	1
of	1

And	1
upon	1
these	1
I	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
my	1

many	1
of	1
the	1

which	1
are	1

For	1

my	1

pondereth	1
them	1

Behold	1

Nevertheless	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1

goodness	1
of	1
the	1

in	1
showing	1
me	1
his	1
great	1

my	1

O	1

Yea	1
my	1

because	1
of	1

of	1
mine	1

2	1
Nephi	1
418	1
18	1
I	1
am	1
encompassed	1

the	1
temptations	1

the	1
sins	1
which	1
do	1
so	1
easily	1
beset	1
me	1
2	1
Nephi	1

And	1
when	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
rejoice	1
my	1

groaneth	1
because	1
of	1
my	1

I	1

My	1

Nephi	1

unto	1
the	1

of	1
my	1

24	1
And	1
by	1

have	1
I	1
waxed	1
bold	1
in	1
mighty	1
prayer	1
before	1
him	1
yea	1
my	1
voice	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
up	1
on	1

angels	1
came	1
down	1

ministered	1
unto	1

2	1
Nephi	1
425	1
25	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit	1
hath	1
my	1
body	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
upon	1
exceedingly	1
high	1
mountains	1
And	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
beheld	1
great	1
things	1
yea	1
even	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
man	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
bidden	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1

426	1
26	1
O	1
then	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
so	1

things	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
his	1
condescension	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
hath	1
visited	1
men	1
in	1
so	1
much	1

why	1
should	1
my	1

my	1

And	1
why	1
should	1
I	1

Yea	1
why	1
should	1
I	1

to	1

that	1

Now	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
me	1
But	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
seek	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life	1
2	1
Nephi	1
55	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
warn	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
should	1
depart	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
2	1
Nephi	1
56	1
6	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
take	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
also	1
Zoram	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
Sam	1
mine	1
elder	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Joseph	1
my	1
younger	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
sisters	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
And	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
were	1
those	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
warnings	1
and	1
the	1
revelations	1
of	1
God	1
wherefore	1
they	1
did	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
2	1
Nephi	1
57	1
7	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
our	1
tents	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
us	1
and	1
did	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
And	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
journeyed	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
2	1
Nephi	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
would	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
call	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Nephi	1
wherefore	1
we	1
did	1
call	1
it	1
Nephi	1
2	1
Nephi	1
59	1
9	1
And	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
did	1
take	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
themselves	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
2	1
Nephi	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
judgments	1
and	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
2	1
Nephi	1
511	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
we	1
did	1
sow	1
seed	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
reap	1
again	1
in	1
abundance	1
And	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
raise	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
animals	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
2	1
Nephi	1
512	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
also	1
brought	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ball	1
or	1
compass	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written	1
2	1
Nephi	1
513	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
to	1
multiply	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
2	1
Nephi	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
it	1
did	1
make	1
many	1
swords	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
now	1
called	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
destroy	1
us	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
their	1
hatred	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
my	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
515	1
15	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
teach	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
build	1
buildings	1
and	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
of	1
copper	1
and	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
of	1
steel	1
and	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
precious	1
ores	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
great	1
abundance	1
2	1
Nephi	1
516	1
16	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
build	1
a	1
temple	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
construct	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Solomon	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
built	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
precious	1
things	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
wherefore	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
built	1
like	1
unto	1
Solomons	1
temple	1
But	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
construction	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Solomon	1
and	1
the	1
workmanship	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fine	1
2	1
Nephi	1
517	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
industrious	1
and	1
to	1
labor	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
2	1
Nephi	1
518	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
But	1
I	1
Nephi	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
2	1
Nephi	1
519	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
ruler	1
and	1
their	1
teacher	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
their	1
ruler	1
and	1
their	1
teacher	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life	1
2	1
Nephi	1
520	1
20	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thy	1
words	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
2	1
Nephi	1
521	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
cursing	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
sore	1
cursing	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
flint	1
wherefore	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
and	1
delightsome	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
enticing	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
did	1
cause	1
a	1
skin	1
of	1
blackness	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
loathsome	1
unto	1
thy	1
people	1
save	1
they	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
2	1
Nephi	1
523	1
23	1
And	1
cursed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
mixeth	1
with	1
their	1
seed	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cursed	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cursing	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
2	1
Nephi	1
524	1
24	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
cursing	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
did	1
become	1
an	1
idle	1
people	1
full	1
of	1
mischief	1
and	1
subtlety	1
and	1
did	1
seek	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey	1
2	1
Nephi	1
525	1
25	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
scourge	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
remember	1
me	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
they	1
shall	1
scourge	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
2	1
Nephi	1
526	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
did	1
consecrate	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Joseph	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
527	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
lived	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
happiness	1
2	1
Nephi	1
528	1
28	1
And	1
thirty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
we	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
2	1
Nephi	1
529	1
29	1
And	1
I	1
Nephi	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
records	1
upon	1
my	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
thus	1
far	1
2	1
Nephi	1
530	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Make	1
other	1
plates	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
engraven	1
many	1
things	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
sight	1
for	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
531	1
31	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
Nephi	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
went	1
and	1
made	1
these	1
plates	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
engraven	1
these	1
things	1
2	1
Nephi	1
532	1
32	1
And	1
I	1
engraved	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
God	1
And	1
if	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
mine	1
engravings	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
2	1
Nephi	1
533	1
33	1
And	1
if	1
my	1
people	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
more	1
particular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
they	1
must	1
search	1
mine	1
other	1
plates	1
2	1
Nephi	1
534	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
forty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1

The	1

Jacob	1
the	1

unto	1

2	1
Nephi	1
62	1
2	1
Behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
Jacob	1
having	1
been	1
called	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
ordained	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
order	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
consecrated	1
by	1
my	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
unto	1
whom	1
ye	1
look	1
as	1
a	1
king	1
or	1
a	1
protector	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
ye	1
depend	1
for	1
safety	1
behold	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
exceedingly	1
many	1
things	1
2	1
Nephi	1
63	1
3	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
desirous	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
your	1
souls	1
Yea	1
mine	1
anxiety	1
is	1
great	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
ever	1
has	1
been	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
exhorted	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
2	1
Nephi	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
you	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
my	1
brother	1
has	1
desired	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
And	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
and	1
glorify	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
65	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
read	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
Isaiah	1
spake	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
wherefore	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Isaiah	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
66	1

And	1
now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
standard	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
thy	1
sons	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
2	1
Nephi	1

And	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1

fathers	1
and	1
their	1
queens	1
thy	1
nursing	1
mothers	1
they	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
towards	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
lick	1
up	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
thy	1
feet	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Jacob	1
would	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
these	1
words	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
shown	1
me	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
whence	1
we	1
came	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
and	1
carried	1

Nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
again	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
has	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
should	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
should	1
manifest	1
himself	1
they	1
should	1
scourge	1
him	1
and	1
crucify	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
who	1
spake	1
it	1
unto	1
me	1
2	1
Nephi	1
610	1
10	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
stiffened	1
their	1
necks	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
behold	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
and	1
afflicted	1
2	1
Nephi	1
611	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
driven	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
angel	1
many	1
shall	1
be	1
afflicted	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
suffered	1
to	1
perish	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
faithful	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1

smitten	1
and	1
hated	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1

be	1
that	1

unite	1
themselves	1

God	1

the	1

Wherefore	1
they	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
Zion	1

of	1
the	1

shall	1

For	1

unto	1
the	1

And	1
they	1

destroyed	1
both	1
by	1

waste	1

unto	1
those	1
at	1

from	1
whence	1
we	1
came	1
for	1
it	1

that	1

for	1
it	1
behooveth	1

there	1

the	1

the	1

and	1
how	1
great	1
his	1
condescensions	1
unto	1

and	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
greatness	1
and	1
his	1
grace	1

he	1
has	1
promised	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
our	1
seed	1
shall	1
not	1
utterly	1
be	1
destroyed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

that	1
he	1

now	1

on	1
the	1

I	1
will	1

And	1
now	1
I	1

unto	1
you	1
again	1
my	1

concerning	1

of	1
which	1
I	1

2	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
promises	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
are	1
promises	1
unto	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
wherefore	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
children	1
shall	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
nevertheless	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
many	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
that	1
they	1
may	1

Wherefore	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
must	1

be	1
expedient	1
that	1
Christfor	1
in	1
the	1
last	1

the	1

spake	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
this	1

among	1
the	1
Jews	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
crucify	1
himfor	1
thus	1
it	1
behooveth	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
there	1
is	1

For	1
should	1
the	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
be	1
wrought	1

they	1

repent	1

But	1
because	1
of	1
priestcrafts	1

iniquities	1
they	1
at	1

will	1
stiffen	1

Wherefore	1
because	1
of	1
their	1

destructions	1
famines	1

shall	1
come	1
upon	1

But	1
behold	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
When	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
believe	1
in	1

have	1
I	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1

that	1

Yea	1
the	1

be	1
nursing	1

unto	1

wherefore	1
the	1

are	1
great	1
unto	1
the	1

for	1
he	1
hath	1

who	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1010	1

But	1
behold	1
this	1
land	1
said	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1

of	1
thine	1

And	1
this	1

there	1

And	1
I	1

1013	1

And	1
he	1
that	1

against	1

shall	1
perish	1
saith	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1014	1
14	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
raiseth	1
up	1
a	1
king	1
against	1
me	1
shall	1
perish	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
heaven	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
I	1

forever	1
that	1
hear	1

Wherefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
that	1
my	1

may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1

that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1

I	1
must	1
needs	1
destroy	1
the	1
secret	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
of	1
murders	1
and	1
of	1
abominations	1

Wherefore	1
he	1
that	1
fighteth	1
against	1

both	1
Jew	1
and	1
Gentile	1
both	1
bond	1
and	1
free	1
both	1
male	1

shall	1

for	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
the	1

of	1
all	1
the	1

for	1
they	1

God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1017	1

For	1
I	1
will	1
fulfil	1
my	1

which	1
I	1

unto	1
the	1

Wherefore	1
my	1

thus	1
saith	1
our	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
afflict	1
thy	1
seed	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1

nevertheless	1
I	1
will	1
soften	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
them	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
and	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1019	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
consecrate	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
thy	1
seed	1
forever	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
choice	1
land	1
saith	1
God	1
unto	1
me	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
dwell	1
thereon	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
worship	1
me	1
saith	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1020	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
seeing	1
that	1
our	1
merciful	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
so	1
great	1
knowledge	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
let	1
us	1
remember	1
him	1
and	1
lay	1
aside	1
our	1
sins	1
and	1
not	1
hang	1
down	1
our	1
heads	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
cast	1
off	1
nevertheless	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
better	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
our	1
path	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
upon	1
an	1
isle	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1021	1
21	1
But	1
great	1
are	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
wherefore	1
as	1
it	1
says	1
isles	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
this	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
inhabited	1
also	1
by	1
our	1
brethren	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1022	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
has	1
led	1
away	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
remembereth	1
all	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
broken	1
off	1
wherefore	1
he	1
remembereth	1
us	1
also	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1023	1
23	1
Therefore	1
cheer	1
up	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
remember	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
act	1
for	1

2	1

1024	1
24	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
reconcile	1
yourselves	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
remember	1
after	1
ye	1
are	1
reconciled	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
saved	1

Wherefore	1
may	1
God	1
raise	1
you	1
from	1

by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
everlasting	1
death	1
by	1
the	1

that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
write	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
his	1

For	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1
his	1

unto	1
my	1

and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
unto	1
all	1
my	1

my	1
brother	1
Jacob	1
also	1
has	1
seen	1

as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
their	1
words	1
forth	1
unto	1
my	1

to	1
prove	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
my	1

Wherefore	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
three	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
word	1

he	1
proveth	1
all	1
his	1

Behold	1
my	1

unto	1
my	1

the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1

for	1
for	1
this	1

hath	1
the	1

in	1
his	1
justice	1

And	1
my	1

should	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
some	1
of	1
the	1

Isaiah	1
that	1
whoso	1

Now	1
these	1
are	1

The	1

concerning	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1

in	1

And	1
he	1
shall	1

shall	1
rebuke	1

Therefore	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
thy	1

In	1
mine	1

said	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1

of	1
a	1

many	1

Nephi	1
1510	1

Yea	1
ten	1

of	1

shall	1
yield	1

1511	1
11	1
Wo	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1

And	1
the	1

the	1

the	1

neither	1
consider	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1513	1
13	1
Therefore	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge	1
and	1
their	1

famished	1
and	1
their	1
multitude	1
dried	1
up	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1514	1
14	1
Therefore	1
hell	1
hath	1
enlarged	1
herself	1

opened	1

without	1

their	1

he	1
that	1

descend	1

it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1515	1
15	1
And	1
the	1

man	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1

Nephi	1
1517	1
17	1
Then	1
shall	1

Wo	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
draw	1
iniquity	1

That	1

Let	1
him	1

hasten	1
his	1
work	1
that	1

come	1
that	1
we	1

it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1520	1
20	1
Wo	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
evil	1
good	1
and	1
good	1
evil	1
that	1
put	1
darkness	1
for	1

Nephi	1
1521	1
21	1
Wo	1
unto	1

1522	1
22	1
Wo	1
unto	1
the	1

to	1
drink	1

men	1
of	1
strength	1
to	1
mingle	1
strong	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1523	1
23	1
Who	1
justify	1
the	1

for	1
reward	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
him	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1524	1
24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
consumeth	1
the	1
chaff	1
their	1
root	1
shall	1
be	1
rottenness	1
and	1
their	1
blossoms	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
as	1
dust	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
and	1
despised	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1525	1
25	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
kindled	1
against	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
hath	1
smitten	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
did	1
tremble	1
and	1
their	1
carcasses	1
were	1
torn	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1

For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1526	1
26	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
to	1
the	1
nations	1
from	1
far	1
and	1
will	1
hiss	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1

none	1

Nephi	1
1527	1

None	1

Nephi	1
1528	1

Whose	1
arrows	1
shall	1
be	1
sharp	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
bows	1
bent	1
and	1
their	1
horses	1

shall	1
be	1
counted	1
like	1

like	1
a	1

their	1
roaring	1
like	1
a	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1529	1
29	1
They	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
young	1

yea	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1530	1
30	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
against	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1

Nephi	1
161	1
1	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
king	1
Uzziah	1
died	1
I	1
saw	1
also	1
the	1
Lord	1
sitting	1
upon	1
a	1
throne	1
high	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
and	1
his	1

filled	1

2	1
Nephi	1
162	1
2	1
Above	1
it	1
stood	1
the	1
seraphim	1
each	1
one	1
had	1
six	1
wings	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
with	1

he	1
did	1
fly	1
2	1
Nephi	1
163	1
3	1
And	1
one	1
cried	1
unto	1
another	1
and	1
said	1
Holy	1

holy	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1

the	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
2	1
Nephi	1
164	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
posts	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
cried	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke	1
2	1
Nephi	1
165	1
5	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
Wo	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
undone	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips	1
and	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips	1
for	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
King	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
2	1
Nephi	1
166	1
6	1
Then	1
flew	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seraphim	1
unto	1
me	1
having	1
a	1
live	1
coal	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar	1
2	1
Nephi	1
167	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
said	1
Lo	1
this	1
has	1
touched	1
thy	1
lips	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
and	1
thy	1
sin	1
purged	1
2	1
Nephi	1
168	1
8	1
Also	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
send	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
us	1
Then	1
I	1
said	1
Here	1
am	1
I	1
send	1
me	1
2	1
Nephi	1
169	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Go	1

tell	1
this	1

ye	1
indeed	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1

2	1
Nephi	1
1610	1
10	1
Make	1
the	1
heart	1

this	1

make	1
their	1

be	1

be	1
healed	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1611	1
11	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
Lord	1
how	1
long	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Until	1
the	1

wasted	1

the	1

king	1
of	1

and	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1

to	1

against	1
it	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
172	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
saying	1
Syria	1
is	1
confederate	1
with	1
Ephraim	1
And	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
moved	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1

as	1
the	1

moved	1

Then	1
said	1
the	1

unto	1

Go	1
forth	1

Ahaz	1
thou	1
and	1

Nephi	1
174	1
4	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
Take	1
heed	1
and	1
be	1
quiet	1
fear	1
not	1
neither	1
be	1
fainthearted	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
tails	1
of	1
these	1
smoking	1
firebrands	1
for	1
the	1

Syria	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
2	1
Nephi	1
175	1
5	1
Because	1
Syria	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
have	1
taken	1
evil	1
counsel	1
against	1
thee	1
saying	1
2	1
Nephi	1
176	1
6	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
Judah	1
and	1
vex	1
it	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
breach	1
therein	1
for	1

set	1
a	1

in	1

the	1

of	1
Tabeal	1
2	1
Nephi	1
177	1
7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1

For	1
the	1

the	1

Rezin	1

within	1

ye	1

Nephi	1
1710	1
10	1
Moreover	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
again	1
unto	1
Ahaz	1
saying	1
2	1
Nephi	1
1711	1
11	1
Ask	1
thee	1
a	1

But	1

said	1

For	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
in	1
thy	1
heart	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
my	1
throne	1

I	1

2414	1
14	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
above	1

I	1
will	1
be	1
like	1

2415	1
15	1
Yet	1
thou	1

be	1

Nephi	1
2416	1
16	1
They	1
that	1
see	1
thee	1
shall	1
narrowly	1
look	1
upon	1
thee	1
and	1
shall	1
consider	1
thee	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
tremble	1
that	1
did	1
shake	1

2	1
Nephi	1
2417	1
17	1
And	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness	1

destroyed	1
the	1

thereof	1

opened	1

All	1

But	1
thou	1
art	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1

like	1
an	1
abominable	1
branch	1

2420	1
20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1

joined	1
with	1

in	1

thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thy	1

thy	1

Prepare	1

for	1

For	1

2423	1

I	1
will	1

make	1
it	1
a	1

for	1
the	1

The	1

Surely	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1

2425	1
25	1
That	1
I	1

in	1
my	1

upon	1
my	1

tread	1
him	1

shall	1
his	1

This	1
is	1
the	1

is	1
purposed	1

For	1
the	1

disannul	1
And	1

1	1
Now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
do	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
For	1
behold	1
Isaiah	1
spake	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
hard	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
understand	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
concerning	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
prophesying	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
2	1
Nephi	1
252	1
2	1
For	1
I	1
Nephi	1
have	1
not	1
taught	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
for	1
their	1
works	1
were	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
their	1
doings	1
were	1
doings	1
of	1
abominations	1
2	1
Nephi	1
253	1
3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
shall	1
receive	1
hereafter	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
nations	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
2	1
Nephi	1
254	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
hearken	1
O	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
because	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
are	1
not	1
plain	1
unto	1
you	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
are	1
plain	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
But	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
prophecy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
wherefore	1
I	1
shall	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
plainness	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
behold	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
plainness	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
2	1
Nephi	1
255	1
5	1
Yea	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
for	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
hath	1
beheld	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
do	1
understand	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
people	1
that	1
understand	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
taught	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
2	1
Nephi	1
256	1
6	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
Nephi	1
have	1
not	1
taught	1
my	1
children	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
of	1
myself	1
have	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
regions	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
mention	1
unto	1
my	1
children	1
concerning	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
hath	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
my	1
children	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
Isaiah	1
hath	1
spoken	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
257	1
7	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
proceed	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
prophecy	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
plainness	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
err	1
nevertheless	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
men	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
at	1
the	1
times	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
2	1
Nephi	1
258	1
8	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
worth	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
supposeth	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
particularly	1
and	1
confine	1
the	1
words	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
people	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
they	1
understand	1
them	1
wherefore	1
for	1
their	1
good	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
259	1
9	1
And	1
as	1
one	1
generation	1
hath	1
been	1
destroyed	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
even	1
so	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
destroyed	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
never	1
hath	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
been	1
destroyed	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
foretold	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2510	1
10	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
told	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
immediately	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
prophecy	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2511	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
again	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
wherefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2512	1
12	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
wars	1
and	1
rumors	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
the	1
Only	1

of	1
the	1
Father	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
of	1
earth	1
shall	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
behold	1
they	1
will	1
reject	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
the	1
stiffness	1
of	1
their	1
necks	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2513	1
13	1
Behold	1
they	1
will	1
crucify	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
is	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1

with	1
healing	1
in	1
his	1
wings	1
and	1
all	1
those	1

on	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1

Wherefore	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
to	1
prophesy	1
concerning	1
him	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
day	1

my	1

And	1

risen	1
from	1

look	1
not	1
forward	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
another	1
Messiah	1
then	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
day	1
will	1
come	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
expedient	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
these	1
things	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2517	1
17	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
set	1
his	1
hand	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
restore	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
lost	1
and	1
fallen	1
state	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
and	1
a	1
wonder	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2518	1
18	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
his	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
words	1
shall	1
judge	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
convincing	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
Messiah	1
who	1
was	1
rejected	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
convincing	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
look	1
forward	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
a	1
Messiah	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
any	1
come	1
save	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
false	1
Messiah	1
which	1
should	1
deceive	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
save	1
one	1
Messiah	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
that	1
Messiah	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2519	1
19	1
For	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
the	1
Messiah	1
cometh	1
in	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2520	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
plainly	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
err	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
liveth	1
that	1
brought	1
Israel	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
Moses	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
heal	1
the	1
nations	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
bitten	1
by	1
the	1
poisonous	1
serpents	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
cast	1
their	1
eyes	1
unto	1
the	1
serpent	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
raise	1
up	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
the	1
rock	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
should	1
come	1
forth	1
yea	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
as	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
liveth	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
name	1
given	1
under	1
heaven	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
this	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
whereby	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2521	1
21	1
Wherefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
promised	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
and	1
handed	1
down	1
unto	1
my	1
seed	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
unto	1
Joseph	1
that	1
his	1
seed	1
should	1
never	1
perish	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
should	1
stand	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2522	1
22	1
Wherefore	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
go	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
who	1
shall	1
possess	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2523	1
23	1
For	1
we	1
labor	1
diligently	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
persuade	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
brethren	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
grace	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
saved	1
after	1
all	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2524	1
24	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
we	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
we	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
and	1
look	1
forward	1
with	1
steadfastness	1
unto	1
Christ	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2525	1
25	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
end	1
was	1
the	1
law	1
given	1
wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
hath	1
become	1
dead	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
alive	1
in	1
Christ	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
faith	1
yet	1
we	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2526	1
26	1
And	1
we	1
talk	1
of	1
Christ	1
we	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Christ	1
we	1
preach	1
of	1
Christ	1
we	1
prophesy	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
we	1
write	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
prophecies	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
may	1
know	1
to	1
what	1
source	1
they	1
may	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2527	1
27	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
speak	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
they	1
by	1
knowing	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
may	1
look	1
forward	1
unto	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
know	1
for	1
what	1
end	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
given	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
Christ	1
that	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
law	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2528	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
people	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
plainly	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
misunderstand	1
And	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
shall	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
you	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
sufficient	1
to	1
teach	1
any	1
man	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
is	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
deny	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
by	1
denying	1
him	1
ye	1
also	1
deny	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2529	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
is	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
deny	1
him	1
not	1
and	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
might	1
mind	1
and	1
strength	1
and	1
your	1
whole	1
soul	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
nowise	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2530	1
30	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
expedient	1
ye	1
must	1
keep	1
the	1
performances	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
God	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1

Moses	1

261	1
1	1
And	1
after	1
Christ	1
shall	1
have	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
he	1
shall	1
show	1
himself	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
2	1
Nephi	1
262	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
beheld	1
that	1
many	1
generations	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
263	1
3	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
Messiah	1
shall	1
come	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
signs	1
given	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
birth	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
resurrection	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
shall	1
that	1
day	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
and	1
they	1
perish	1
because	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
stone	1
them	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
wherefore	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
shall	1
ascend	1
up	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
against	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
264	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
proud	1
and	1
that	1
do	1
wickedly	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
up	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
stubble	1
2	1
Nephi	1
265	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
kill	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
saints	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
swallow	1
them	1
up	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
and	1
mountains	1
shall	1
cover	1
them	1
and	1
whirlwinds	1
shall	1

shall	1

to	1
pieces	1
and	1
grind	1
them	1
to	1
powder	1
2	1
Nephi	1
266	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
visited	1
with	1
thunderings	1
and	1
lightnings	1
and	1
earthquakes	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
destructions	1
for	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
stubble	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
shall	1
consume	1
them	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
2	1
Nephi	1
267	1
7	1
O	1
the	1
pain	1
and	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
For	1
I	1
Nephi	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
well	1
nigh	1
consumeth	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
cry	1
unto	1
my	1
God	1
Thy	1
ways	1
are	1
just	1
2	1
Nephi	1
268	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
righteous	1
that	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
not	1
but	1
look	1
forward	1
unto	1
Christ	1
with	1
steadfastness	1
for	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
are	1
given	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
persecutionbehold	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
2	1
Nephi	1
269	1
9	1
But	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
appear	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
heal	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
peace	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
three	1
generations	1
shall	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
shall	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
righteousness	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2610	1
10	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
a	1
speedy	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
for	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
and	1
they	1
sell	1
themselves	1
for	1
naught	1
for	1
for	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
pride	1
and	1
their	1
foolishness	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
destruction	1
for	1
because	1
they	1
yield	1
unto	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
choose	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
rather	1
than	1
light	1
therefore	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2611	1
11	1
For	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
strive	1
with	1
man	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Spirit	1
ceaseth	1
to	1
strive	1
with	1
man	1
then	1
cometh	1
speedy	1
destruction	1
and	1
this	1
grieveth	1
my	1
soul	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2612	1
12	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
convincing	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Christ	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
convinced	1
also	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
the	1
Eternal	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2613	1
13	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
manifesteth	1
himself	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
yea	1
unto	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
working	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2614	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
concerning	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
bring	1
these	1
things	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2615	1
15	1
After	1
my	1
seed	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
shall	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
smitten	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
yea	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
have	1
camped	1
against	1
them	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
laid	1
siege	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
mount	1

For	1

For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1

They	1

those	1
who	1

Wherefore	1
as	1

have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
speedily	1
and	1
the	1

Nephi	1
2619	1
19	1
And	1
it	1

that	1
those	1

smitten	1

2620	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
have	1
stumbled	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
stumbling	1
block	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
built	1
up	1
many	1

nevertheless	1
they	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
power	1

miracles	1
of	1

and	1
preach	1
up	1
unto	1
themselves	1
their	1
own	1
wisdom	1

their	1
own	1
learning	1
that	1
they	1
may	1

And	1
there	1

the	1

of	1

For	1

even	1
that	1

down	1

Behold	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1

Behold	1

He	1

2	1
Nephi	1
2630	1
30	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
forbidden	1
this	1
thing	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
that	1
all	1

should	1
have	1
charity	1
which	1
charity	1
is	1
love	1
and	1
except	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
charity	1
they	1
were	1
nothing	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
have	1

they	1
would	1

suffer	1
the	1

Nephi	1
2631	1

But	1
the	1

And	1
again	1
the	1

unto	1
the	1

for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
that	1
the	1

the	1

should	1
speak	1
as	1
if	1

were	1
from	1
the	1

2	1
Nephi	1
2714	1
14	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
as	1
many	1
witnesses	1
as	1
seemeth	1
him	1

will	1
he	1
establish	1
his	1

wo	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
rejecteth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2715	1

But	1
behold	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
book	1
Take	1
these	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
sealed	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
show	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
learned	1
saying	1
Read	1
this	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
And	1
the	1
learned	1
shall	1
say	1
Bring	1
hither	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2716	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
will	1
they	1
say	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2717	1
17	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
I	1
cannot	1
bring	1
the	1
book	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
sealed	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2718	1
18	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
learned	1
say	1
I	1
cannot	1
read	1
it	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2719	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
deliver	1
again	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
thereof	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
not	1

the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
not	1

shall	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
learned	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2720	1
20	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
The	1
learned	1
shall	1
not	1
read	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1

I	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2721	1
21	1
Touch	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
sealed	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
mine	1

2	1
Nephi	1
2722	1
22	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
read	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee	1
and	1
obtained	1
the	1
witnesses	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
unto	1
thee	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
book	1
again	1
and	1
hide	1
it	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
read	1
until	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
fit	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
wisdom	1
to	1
reveal	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2723	1
23	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
I	1
work	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2724	1
24	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
shall	1
read	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
him	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2725	1
25	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
people	1
draw	1
near	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
lips	1
do	1
honor	1
me	1
but	1
have	1
removed	1
their	1
hearts	1
far	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
their	1
fear	1
towards	1
me	1
is	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
precepts	1
of	1
men	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2726	1
26	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
and	1
a	1
wonder	1
for	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
their	1
wise	1
and	1
learned	1
shall	1
perish	1
and	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
their	1
prudent	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2727	1
27	1
And	1
wo	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
deep	1
to	1
hide	1
their	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
Who	1
seeth	1
us	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
us	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
say	1
Surely	1
your	1
turning	1
of	1
things	1
upside	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
the	1
potters	1
clay	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
them	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
their	1
works	1
For	1
shall	1
the	1
work	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
he	1
made	1
me	1
not	1
Or	1
shall	1
the	1
thing	1
framed	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
framed	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
understanding	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2728	1
28	1
But	1
behold	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while	1
and	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
a	1
forest	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2729	1
29	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
shall	1
see	1
out	1
of	1
obscurity	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2730	1
30	1
And	1
the	1
meek	1
also	1
shall	1
increase	1
and	1
their	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
among	1
men	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2731	1
31	1
For	1
assuredly	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
terrible	1
one	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
naught	1
and	1
the	1
scorner	1
is	1
consumed	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
watch	1
for	1
iniquity	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2732	1
32	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
an	1
offender	1
for	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
lay	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
reproveth	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
naught	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2733	1
33	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
redeemed	1
Abraham	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
ashamed	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
face	1
now	1
wax	1
pale	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2734	1
34	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
his	1
children	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
2735	1
35	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
erred	1
in	1
spirit	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
understanding	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
murmured	1
shall	1
learn	1

Chapter	1

2	1
Nephi	1
281	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
Spirit	1
hath	1
constrained	1
me	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
surely	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
2	1
Nephi	1
282	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
especially	1
unto	1
our	1
seed	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
283	1
3	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1

when	1
the	1

unto	1
the	1

Behold	1
I	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lords	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
shall	1
say	1
I	1
I	1
am	1

thus	1
shall	1
every	1
one	1
say	1
that	1
hath	1
built	1
up	1
churches	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
2	1
Nephi	1
284	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
contend	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
their	1
priests	1
shall	1
contend	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
with	1
their	1
learning	1
and	1
deny	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
giveth	1
utterance	1
2	1
Nephi	1
285	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
deny	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1

Hearken	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
hear	1
ye	1
our	1
precept	1
for	1
behold	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
today	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
hath	1
done	1
his	1

he	1
hath	1
given	1
his	1

unto	1

2	1
Nephi	1
286	1

Behold	1
hearken	1
ye	1
unto	1
my	1
precept	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
miracle	1
wrought	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
believe	1
it	1

for	1
this	1

he	1
hath	1
done	1
his	1
work	1
2	1
Nephi	1
287	1

Yea	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1

Eat	1

many	1
which	1

Eat	1

be	1
merry	1
nevertheless	1
fear	1
Godhe	1
will	1
justify	1
in	1
committing	1
a	1
little	1
sin	1

lie	1
a	1

all	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
we	1

if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
guilty	1
God	1
will	1
beat	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
few	1

and	1
at	1

be	1
saved	1

Nephi	1
289	1
9	1
Yea	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
which	1
shall	1

after	1
this	1
manner	1
false	1

seek	1
deep	1
to	1
hide	1
their	1
counsels	1
from	1

their	1
works	1
shall	1

Nephi	1
2810	1

And	1
the	1

2	1
Nephi	1

Yea	1
they	1

all	1
gone	1

of	1

their	1

For	1
the	1

the	1

O	1

O	1
ye	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
ye	1
remembered	1

Nay	1

ye	1
have	1
cursed	1
them	1

have	1
hated	1
them	1

have	1
not	1
sought	1
to	1

I	1

return	1
all	1
these	1

Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1

you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1

Wherefore	1
I	1

And	1
when	1
the	1

the	1

2	1
Nephi	1

And	1
I	1

this	1

because	1
that	1

ye	1

I	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
I	1
Nephi	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
be	1
For	1
behold	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
2	1
Nephi	1
302	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
as	1
will	1
repent	1
are	1
the	1
covenant	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
as	1
will	1
not	1
repent	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
covenanteth	1
with	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
repent	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
Son	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
303	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
prophesy	1
somewhat	1
more	1
concerning	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
For	1
after	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
be	1
written	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
which	1
shall	1
believe	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
our	1
seed	1
2	1
Nephi	1
304	1
4	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
our	1
seed	1
know	1
concerning	1
us	1
how	1
that	1
we	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
descendants	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
2	1
Nephi	1
305	1
5	1
And	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
declared	1
among	1
them	1
wherefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
which	1
was	1
had	1
among	1
their	1
fathers	1
2	1
Nephi	1
306	1
6	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
rejoice	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
blessing	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
their	1
scales	1
of	1
darkness	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
fall	1
from	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
many	1
generations	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
among	1
them	1
save	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
pure	1
and	1
delightsome	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
307	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
also	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
gather	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
shall	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
also	1
become	1
a	1
delightsome	1
people	1
2	1
Nephi	1
308	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
commence	1
his	1
work	1
among	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
2	1
Nephi	1
309	1
9	1
And	1
with	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
judge	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
reprove	1
with	1
equity	1
for	1
the	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
shall	1
he	1
slay	1
the	1
wicked	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3010	1
10	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
speedily	1
cometh	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
cause	1
a	1
great	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
will	1
he	1
destroy	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
spare	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
destroy	1
the	1
wicked	1
by	1
fire	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3011	1
11	1
And	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
and	1
faithfulness	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
reins	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3012	1
12	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
wolf	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
lamb	1
and	1
the	1
leopard	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
kid	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
fatling	1
together	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3013	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
cow	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
shall	1
feed	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
together	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
shall	1
eat	1
straw	1
like	1
the	1
ox	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3014	1
14	1
And	1
the	1
sucking	1
child	1
shall	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
asp	1

the	1

shall	1
put	1
his	1

on	1
the	1
cockatrices	1

2	1
Nephi	1
3015	1
15	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
nor	1
destroy	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1

2	1
Nephi	1
3016	1
16	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1

all	1
things	1
shall	1

There	1
is	1

it	1
shall	1
be	1

there	1
is	1
no	1

it	1

it	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1

Wherefore	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
revealed	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
shall	1
at	1

no	1

for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1

I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
my	1

Nephi	1
31	1
Chapter	1
31	1
2	1
Nephi	1
311	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
prophesying	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
And	1
I	1
cannot	1
write	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
must	1
surely	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
neither	1
can	1
I	1
write	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
Jacob	1
2	1
Nephi	1
312	1
2	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
concerning	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ	1
wherefore	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
plainly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
my	1
prophesying	1
2	1
Nephi	1
313	1
3	1
For	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
plainness	1
for	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
doth	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
work	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
giveth	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
understanding	1
for	1
he	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
language	1
unto	1
their	1
understanding	1
2	1
Nephi	1
314	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
that	1
prophet	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
showed	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
should	1
baptize	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
2	1
Nephi	1
315	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
being	1
holy	1
should	1
have	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
by	1
water	1
to	1
fulfil	1
all	1
righteousness	1
O	1
then	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
need	1
have	1
we	1
being	1
unholy	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
yea	1
even	1
by	1
water	1
2	1
Nephi	1
316	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
wherein	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
fulfil	1
all	1
righteousness	1
in	1
being	1
baptized	1
by	1
water	1
2	1
Nephi	1
317	1
7	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
holy	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
he	1
being	1
holy	1
he	1
showeth	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
he	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
witnesseth	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
keeping	1
his	1
commandments	1
2	1
Nephi	1
318	1
8	1
Wherefore	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
baptized	1
with	1
water	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
descended	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
dove	1
2	1
Nephi	1
319	1
9	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
showeth	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
the	1
straightness	1
of	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
the	1
narrowness	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
enter	1
he	1
having	1
set	1
the	1
example	1
before	1
them	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3110	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Follow	1
thou	1
me	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
can	1
we	1
follow	1
Jesus	1
save	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3111	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Father	1
said	1
Repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
Beloved	1
Son	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3112	1
12	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
the	1
Father	1
give	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
like	1
unto	1
me	1
wherefore	1
follow	1
me	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
me	1
do	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3113	1
13	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
follow	1
the	1
Son	1
with	1
full	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
acting	1
no	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
no	1
deception	1
before	1
God	1
but	1
with	1
real	1
intent	1
repenting	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
witnessing	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
by	1
baptismyea	1
by	1
following	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
your	1
Savior	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
behold	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
yea	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
then	1
can	1
ye	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
shout	1
praises	1
unto	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3114	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
thus	1
came	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
After	1
ye	1
have	1
repented	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
witnessed	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
by	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
can	1
speak	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
tongue	1
yea	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
should	1
deny	1
me	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
me	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3115	1
15	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
saying	1
Yea	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
Beloved	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
faithful	1
He	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3116	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
this	1
that	1
unless	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
endure	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
in	1
following	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
2	1
Nephi	1
3117	1
17	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
your	1
Redeemer	1
should	1
do	1
for	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
shown	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
gate	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
should	1
enter	1
For	1
the	1

And	1
then	1

ye	1
in	1

which	1
leads	1
to	1
eternal	1

yea	1
ye	1

ye	1
have	1

unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
gotten	1
into	1
this	1
strait	1

I	1
would	1
ask	1
if	1
all	1
is	1
done	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
thus	1
far	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
with	1
unshaken	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1

Wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
press	1

with	1
a	1
steadfastness	1
in	1
Christ	1
having	1
a	1
perfect	1
brightness	1
of	1
hope	1

a	1
love	1
of	1

Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1

press	1
forward	1
feasting	1
upon	1

endure	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1

this	1

there	1
is	1
none	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1

the	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
ponder	1
somewhat	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
entered	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
But	1
behold	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
ponder	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
2	1
Nephi	1
322	1
2	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
after	1
ye	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
ye	1
could	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
angels	1
And	1
now	1
how	1
could	1
ye	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
angels	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
2	1
Nephi	1
323	1
3	1
Angels	1
speak	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
wherefore	1
they	1
speak	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
feast	1
upon	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
what	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
2	1
Nephi	1
324	1

Wherefore	1
now	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
if	1
ye	1
cannot	1
understand	1
them	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
not	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
knock	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
but	1
must	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
2	1
Nephi	1
325	1
5	1
For	1
behold	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
it	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
what	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
2	1
Nephi	1
326	1

Behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
doctrine	1
given	1
until	1
after	1
he	1
shall	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
to	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Nephi	1
cannot	1

more	1
the	1
Spirit	1
stoppeth	1
mine	1
utterance	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
to	1
mourn	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
unbelief	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
the	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
stiffneckedness	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
search	1
knowledge	1
nor	1
understand	1
great	1
knowledge	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1

And	1
now	1
my	1

I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
ponder	1
still	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
teacheth	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
pray	1
ye	1
would	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
pray	1
for	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
teacheth	1
not	1
a	1

to	1

teacheth	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1

Nephi	1
329	1

But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
pray	1
always	1
and	1
not	1
faint	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
not	1
perform	1
any	1
thing	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
save	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
ye	1
shall	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
consecrate	1
thy	1
performance	1
unto	1
thee	1

against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1

wherefore	1
they	1
cast	1
many	1
things	1
away	1
which	1
are	1

esteem	1
them	1
as	1
things	1

naught	1

But	1
I	1

I	1
esteem	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1

For	1
I	1

the	1

fifty	1

five	1

were	1
lightly	1
concerning	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Jacob	1
13	1
3	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
engraven	1
upon	1
his	1
other	1
plates	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preserve	1
these	1
plates	1
and	1
hand	1
them	1
down	1
unto	1
my	1
seed	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
Jacob	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
preaching	1
which	1
was	1
sacred	1
or	1
revelation	1
which	1
was	1
great	1
or	1
prophesying	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
engraven	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
them	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
and	1
touch	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
Christs	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
Jacob	1
15	1
5	1
For	1
because	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
great	1
anxiety	1
it	1
truly	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
us	1
concerning	1
our	1
people	1
what	1
things	1
should	1
happen	1
unto	1
them	1
Jacob	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
we	1
also	1
had	1
many	1
revelations	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
much	1
prophecy	1
wherefore	1
we	1
knew	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
Jacob	1
17	1
7	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
labored	1
diligently	1
among	1
our	1
people	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
Christ	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
he	1
should	1
swear	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
in	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
temptation	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Jacob	1
18	1
8	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
persuade	1
all	1
men	1
not	1
to	1
rebel	1
against	1
God	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
would	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
view	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
suffer	1
his	1
cross	1
and	1
bear	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
wherefore	1
I	1
Jacob	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
Jacob	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
soon	1
die	1
wherefore	1
he	1
anointed	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
people	1
now	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
reigns	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
Jacob	1
110	1
10	1
The	1
people	1
having	1
loved	1
Nephi	1
exceedingly	1
he	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
protector	1
for	1
them	1
having	1
wielded	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Laban	1
in	1
their	1
defence	1
and	1
having	1
labored	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
for	1
their	1
welfare	1
Jacob	1
111	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
retain	1
in	1
remembrance	1
his	1
name	1
And	1
whoso	1
should	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
second	1
Nephi	1
third	1
Nephi	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
reigns	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
of	1
whatever	1
name	1
they	1
would	1
Jacob	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
died	1
Jacob	1
113	1
13	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
Nephites	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
Jacobites	1
Josephites	1
Zoramites	1
Lamanites	1
Lemuelites	1
and	1
Ishmaelites	1
Jacob	1
114	1
14	1
But	1
I	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
not	1
hereafter	1
distinguish	1
them	1
by	1
these	1
names	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
them	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
friendly	1
to	1
Nephi	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
Nephites	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
reigns	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
Jacob	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
under	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
king	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
hard	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
indulge	1
themselves	1
somewhat	1
in	1
wicked	1
practices	1
such	1
as	1
like	1
unto	1
David	1
of	1
old	1
desiring	1
many	1
wives	1
and	1
concubines	1
and	1
also	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son	1
Jacob	1
116	1
16	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
search	1
much	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
somewhat	1
in	1
pride	1
Jacob	1
117	1
17	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
these	1
words	1
as	1
I	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
having	1
first	1
obtained	1
mine	1
errand	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jacob	1
118	1
18	1
For	1
I	1
Jacob	1
and	1
my	1
brother	1
Joseph	1
had	1
been	1
consecrated	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Jacob	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
magnify	1
our	1
office	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
taking	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
responsibility	1
answering	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
our	1
own	1
heads	1
if	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
wherefore	1
by	1
laboring	1
with	1
our	1
might	1
their	1
blood	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
our	1
garments	1
otherwise	1
their	1
blood	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
our	1
garments	1
and	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
spotless	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1

1	1
The	1
words	1
which	1
Jacob	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Nephi	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Jacob	1
22	1
2	1
Now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
Jacob	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
responsibility	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
magnify	1
mine	1
office	1
with	1
soberness	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rid	1
my	1
garments	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
I	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
23	1
3	1
And	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
hitherto	1
been	1
diligent	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
my	1
calling	1
but	1
I	1
this	1
day	1
am	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
much	1
more	1
desire	1
and	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
your	1
souls	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
hitherto	1
been	1
Jacob	1
24	1
4	1
For	1
behold	1
as	1
yet	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
Jacob	1
25	1
5	1
But	1
behold	1
hearken	1
ye	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
allpowerful	1
Creator	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
thoughts	1
how	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
labor	1
in	1
sin	1
which	1
sin	1
appeareth	1
very	1
abominable	1
unto	1
me	1
yea	1
and	1
abominable	1
unto	1
God	1
Jacob	1
26	1
6	1
Yea	1
it	1
grieveth	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
causeth	1
me	1
to	1
shrink	1
with	1
shame	1
before	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
Maker	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
Jacob	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
also	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
use	1
so	1
much	1
boldness	1
of	1
speech	1
concerning	1
you	1
before	1
your	1
wives	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
many	1
of	1
whose	1
feelings	1
are	1
exceedingly	1
tender	1
and	1
chaste	1
and	1
delicate	1
before	1
God	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
God	1
Jacob	1
28	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
supposeth	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
up	1
hither	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
pleasing	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
healeth	1
the	1
wounded	1
soul	1
Jacob	1
29	1
9	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
burdeneth	1
my	1
soul	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
constrained	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
strict	1
commandment	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
from	1
God	1
to	1
admonish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
crimes	1
to	1
enlarge	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
already	1
wounded	1
instead	1
of	1
consoling	1
and	1
healing	1
their	1
wounds	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
wounded	1
instead	1
of	1
feasting	1
upon	1
the	1
pleasing	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
have	1
daggers	1
placed	1
to	1
pierce	1
their	1
souls	1
and	1
wound	1
their	1
delicate	1
minds	1
Jacob	1
210	1
10	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
task	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
strict	1
commands	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
tell	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
pure	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
broken	1
heart	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
glance	1
of	1
the	1
piercing	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God	1
Jacob	1
211	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
For	1
behold	1
as	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
thus	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Jacob	1
get	1
thou	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
and	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
Jacob	1
212	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
gold	1
and	1
for	1
silver	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
ores	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
this	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
seed	1
doth	1
abound	1
most	1
plentifully	1
Jacob	1
213	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
providence	1
hath	1
smiled	1
upon	1
you	1
most	1
pleasingly	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
obtained	1
many	1
riches	1
and	1
because	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
obtained	1
more	1
abundantly	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
ye	1
are	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
wear	1
stiff	1
necks	1
and	1
high	1
heads	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
costliness	1
of	1
your	1
apparel	1
and	1
persecute	1
your	1
brethren	1
because	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
Jacob	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
God	1
justifieth	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
But	1
he	1
condemneth	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
persist	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
his	1
judgments	1
must	1
speedily	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
Jacob	1
215	1
15	1
O	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
show	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
pierce	1
you	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
glance	1
of	1
his	1
eye	1
he	1
can	1
smite	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
Jacob	1
216	1
16	1
O	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
rid	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
iniquity	1
and	1
abomination	1
And	1
O	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
listen	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
commands	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
this	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
destroy	1
your	1
souls	1
Jacob	1
217	1
17	1
Think	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
like	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
and	1
be	1
familiar	1
with	1
all	1
and	1
free	1
with	1
your	1
substance	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
rich	1
like	1
unto	1
you	1
Jacob	1
218	1
18	1
But	1
before	1
ye	1
seek	1
for	1
riches	1
seek	1
ye	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
hope	1
in	1
Christ	1
ye	1
shall	1
obtain	1
riches	1
if	1
ye	1
seek	1
them	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
seek	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
intent	1
to	1
do	1
goodto	1
clothe	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
hungry	1
and	1
to	1
liberate	1
the	1
captive	1
and	1
administer	1
relief	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
the	1
afflicted	1
Jacob	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
pride	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
you	1
which	1
have	1
afflicted	1
your	1
neighbor	1
and	1
persecuted	1
him	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
proud	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
what	1
say	1
ye	1
of	1
it	1
Jacob	1
221	1
21	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
abominable	1
unto	1
him	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
flesh	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
being	1
is	1
as	1
precious	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
end	1
hath	1
he	1
created	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
glorify	1
him	1
forever	1
Jacob	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
this	1
pride	1
And	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
a	1
grosser	1
crime	1
my	1
heart	1
would	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
you	1
Jacob	1
223	1
23	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
burdens	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
grosser	1
crimes	1
For	1
behold	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
This	1
people	1
begin	1
to	1
wax	1
in	1
iniquity	1
they	1
understand	1
not	1
the	1
scriptures	1
for	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
excuse	1
themselves	1
in	1
committing	1
whoredoms	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
concerning	1
David	1
and	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son	1
Jacob	1
224	1
24	1
Behold	1
David	1
and	1
Solomon	1
truly	1
had	1
many	1
wives	1
and	1
concubines	1
which	1
thing	1
was	1
abominable	1
before	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jacob	1
225	1
25	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
this	1
people	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
mine	1
arm	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
righteous	1
branch	1
from	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Joseph	1
Jacob	1
226	1
26	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
do	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
Jacob	1
227	1
27	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
brethren	1
hear	1
me	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
have	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
wife	1
and	1
concubines	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
none	1
Jacob	1
228	1
28	1
For	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
chastity	1
of	1
women	1
And	1
whoredoms	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
before	1
me	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
Jacob	1
229	1
29	1
Wherefore	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
or	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
Jacob	1
230	1
30	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
will	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
command	1
my	1
people	1
otherwise	1
they	1
shall	1
hearken	1
unto	1
these	1
things	1
Jacob	1
231	1
31	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
sorrow	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
of	1
their	1
husbands	1
Jacob	1
232	1
32	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
that	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
daughters	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
against	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
Jacob	1
233	1
33	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
lead	1
away	1
captive	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
tenderness	1
save	1
I	1
shall	1
visit	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
curse	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
commit	1
whoredoms	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
Jacob	1
234	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
commandments	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
them	1
before	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
great	1
condemnation	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
Jacob	1
235	1
35	1
Behold	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
greater	1
iniquities	1
than	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
our	1
brethren	1
Ye	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
your	1
tender	1
wives	1
and	1
lost	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
your	1
children	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
bad	1
examples	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
sobbings	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
ascend	1
up	1
to	1
God	1
against	1
you	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
strictness	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
against	1
you	1
many	1
hearts	1
died	1
pierced	1
with	1
deep	1
wounds	1
Jacob	1

Chapter	1
3	1
Jacob	1
31	1
1	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
Jacob	1
would	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
pure	1
in	1
heart	1
Look	1
unto	1
God	1
with	1
firmness	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
console	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
afflictions	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
your	1
cause	1
and	1
send	1
down	1
justice	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
your	1
destruction	1
Jacob	1
32	1
2	1
O	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
pure	1
in	1
heart	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads	1
and	1
receive	1
the	1
pleasing	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
feast	1
upon	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
ye	1
may	1
if	1
your	1
minds	1
are	1
firm	1
forever	1
Jacob	1
33	1
3	1
But	1
wo	1
wo	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
pure	1
in	1
heart	1
that	1
are	1
filthy	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
God	1
for	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
cursed	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
filthy	1
like	1
unto	1
you	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
are	1
cursed	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
cursing	1
shall	1
scourge	1
you	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
Jacob	1
34	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
speedily	1
cometh	1
that	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
righteous	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
Jacob	1
35	1
5	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
your	1
brethren	1
whom	1
ye	1
hate	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
filthiness	1
and	1
the	1
cursing	1
which	1
hath	1
come	1
upon	1
their	1
skins	1
are	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
you	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
our	1
fatherthat	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
one	1
wife	1
and	1
concubines	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
none	1
and	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
whoredoms	1
committed	1
among	1
them	1
Jacob	1
36	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
commandment	1
they	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
wherefore	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
observance	1
in	1
keeping	1
this	1
commandment	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
them	1
but	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
one	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
blessed	1
people	1
Jacob	1
37	1
7	1
Behold	1
their	1
husbands	1
love	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
love	1
their	1
husbands	1
and	1
their	1
husbands	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
love	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
unbelief	1
and	1
their	1
hatred	1
towards	1
you	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
wherefore	1
how	1
much	1
better	1
are	1
you	1
than	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
Creator	1
Jacob	1
38	1
8	1
O	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
unless	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
that	1
their	1
skins	1
will	1
be	1
whiter	1
than	1
yours	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
39	1
9	1
Wherefore	1
a	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
revile	1
no	1
more	1
against	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
their	1
skins	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
revile	1
against	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
filthiness	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
remember	1
your	1
own	1
filthiness	1
and	1
remember	1
that	1
their	1
filthiness	1
came	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
Jacob	1
310	1
10	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
remember	1
your	1
children	1
how	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
grieved	1
their	1
hearts	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
example	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
remember	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
filthiness	1
bring	1
your	1
children	1
unto	1
destruction	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
be	1
heaped	1
upon	1
your	1
heads	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Jacob	1
311	1
11	1
O	1
my	1
brethren	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
arouse	1
the	1
faculties	1
of	1
your	1
souls	1
shake	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
awake	1
from	1
the	1
slumber	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
loose	1
yourselves	1
from	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
become	1
angels	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
that	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
Jacob	1
312	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Jacob	1
spake	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
warning	1
them	1
against	1
fornication	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
and	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
sin	1
telling	1
them	1
the	1
awful	1
consequences	1
of	1
them	1
Jacob	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
numerous	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
but	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
proceedings	1
are	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
larger	1
plates	1
and	1
their	1
wars	1
and	1
their	1
contentions	1
and	1
the	1
reigns	1
of	1
their	1
kings	1
Jacob	1
314	1
14	1
These	1
plates	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
Jacob	1
4	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Jacob	1
41	1
1	1
Now	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Jacob	1
having	1
ministered	1
much	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
word	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
write	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
engraving	1
our	1
words	1
upon	1
plates	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
write	1
upon	1
plates	1
must	1
remain	1
Jacob	1
42	1
2	1
But	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
we	1
write	1
upon	1
anything	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
upon	1
plates	1
must	1
perish	1
and	1
vanish	1
away	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
write	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
upon	1
plates	1
which	1
will	1
give	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
a	1
small	1
degree	1
of	1
knowledge	1
concerning	1
us	1
or	1
concerning	1
their	1
fathers	1
Jacob	1
43	1
3	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
we	1
do	1
rejoice	1
and	1
we	1
labor	1
diligently	1
to	1
engraven	1
these	1
words	1
upon	1
plates	1
hoping	1
that	1
our	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
will	1
receive	1
them	1
with	1
thankful	1
hearts	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
sorrow	1
neither	1
with	1
contempt	1
concerning	1
their	1
first	1
parents	1
Jacob	1
44	1
4	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
have	1
we	1
written	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
knew	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
many	1
hundred	1
years	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
we	1
ourselves	1
had	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
us	1
Jacob	1
45	1
5	1
Behold	1
they	1
believed	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
worshiped	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
also	1
we	1
worship	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
we	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
it	1
pointing	1
our	1
souls	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
it	1
is	1
sanctified	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
righteousness	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
accounted	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
offering	1
up	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
similitude	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
Son	1
Jacob	1
46	1
6	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
search	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
revelations	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
having	1
all	1
these	1
witnesses	1
we	1
obtain	1
a	1
hope	1
and	1
our	1
faith	1
becometh	1
unshaken	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
truly	1
can	1
command	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
trees	1

Nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
showeth	1
us	1
our	1
weakness	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
and	1
his	1
great	1
condescensions	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1

that	1
we	1
have	1
power	1

Jacob	1
48	1

Behold	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
How	1
unsearchable	1
are	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
find	1
out	1
all	1
his	1
ways	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
of	1
his	1
ways	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him	1
wherefore	1
brethren	1
despise	1
not	1
the	1
revelations	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
49	1
9	1
For	1
behold	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
man	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
earth	1
was	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
God	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
man	1
was	1
created	1
O	1
then	1
why	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
earth	1
or	1
the	1
workmanship	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
Jacob	1
410	1
10	1
Wherefore	1
brethren	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
counsel	1
the	1
Lord	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
counsel	1
from	1
his	1
hand	1
For	1
behold	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
counseleth	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
in	1
justice	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
mercy	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
Jacob	1
411	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
be	1
reconciled	1
unto	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
Christ	1
his	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
Son	1
and	1
ye	1
may	1
obtain	1
a	1
resurrection	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
be	1
presented	1
as	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
God	1
having	1
faith	1
and	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
hope	1
of	1
glory	1
in	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
manifesteth	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
Jacob	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
beloved	1
marvel	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
why	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
attain	1
to	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
attain	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
a	1
resurrection	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
Jacob	1
413	1
13	1
Behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
let	1
him	1
prophesy	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
speaketh	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
lieth	1
not	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
speaketh	1
of	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
really	1
are	1
and	1
of	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
really	1
will	1
be	1
wherefore	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
manifested	1
unto	1
us	1
plainly	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
souls	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
witnesses	1
alone	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
God	1
also	1
spake	1
them	1
unto	1
prophets	1
of	1
old	1
Jacob	1
414	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Jews	1
were	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
despised	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
plainness	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
Wherefore	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
blindness	1
which	1
blindness	1
came	1
by	1
looking	1
beyond	1
the	1
mark	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
fall	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
his	1
plainness	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
cannot	1
understand	1
because	1
they	1
desired	1
it	1
And	1
because	1
they	1
desired	1
it	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
stumble	1
Jacob	1
415	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Jacob	1
am	1
led	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
prophesying	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
by	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
stumbling	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
they	1
will	1
reject	1
the	1
stone	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
build	1
and	1
have	1
safe	1
foundation	1
Jacob	1
416	1
16	1
But	1
behold	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures	1
this	1
stone	1
shall	1
become	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sure	1
foundation	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
Jews	1
can	1
build	1
Jacob	1
417	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
these	1
after	1
having	1
rejected	1
the	1
sure	1
foundation	1
can	1
ever	1
build	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
their	1
corner	1
Jacob	1
418	1
18	1
Behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
will	1
unfold	1
this	1
mystery	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
get	1
shaken	1
from	1
my	1
firmness	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
stumble	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
over	1
anxiety	1
for	1
you	1

51	1
1	1
Behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
to	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
saying	1
Jacob	1
52	1
2	1
Hearken	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
me	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jacob	1
53	1

For	1
behold	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1
thee	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
tame	1
olivetree	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took	1
and	1
nourished	1
in	1
his	1
vineyard	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
and	1
waxed	1
old	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
decay	1
Jacob	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
olivetree	1
began	1
to	1
decay	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
prune	1
it	1
and	1
dig	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
nourish	1
it	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
shoot	1
forth	1
young	1
and	1
tender	1
branches	1
and	1
it	1
perish	1
not	1
Jacob	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
pruned	1
it	1
and	1
digged	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
nourished	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
Jacob	1
56	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
put	1
forth	1
somewhat	1
a	1
little	1
young	1
and	1
tender	1
branches	1
but	1
behold	1
the	1
main	1
top	1
thereof	1
began	1
to	1

Jacob	1
57	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
master	1
of	1

it	1
and	1
he	1

unto	1
his	1

It	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1

this	1

go	1

pluck	1
the	1
branches	1
from	1
a	1
wild	1
olivetree	1

bring	1
them	1
hither	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
pluck	1
off	1
those	1
main	1
branches	1
which	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
wither	1
away	1
and	1
we	1

into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
burned	1
Jacob	1
58	1

And	1
behold	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
I	1
take	1
away	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
young	1

it	1
so	1

that	1
the	1

this	1
tree	1
will	1
perish	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
the	1

wherefore	1
I	1

Take	1

in	1
the	1

thereof	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1

did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1

grafted	1
in	1

511	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1

caused	1
that	1

should	1
be	1
digged	1

unto	1

Wherefore	1
go	1
thy	1

it	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
words	1

And	1
these	1

And	1
it	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1

said	1
unto	1

Come	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1

that	1
we	1

labor	1
in	1
the	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
servant	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1

said	1
unto	1
his	1

Behold	1
look	1
here	1
behold	1
the	1
tree	1
Jacob	1
517	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1

looked	1

beheld	1
the	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
wild	1
olive	1
branches	1
had	1
been	1
grafted	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
sprung	1
forth	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
bear	1
fruit	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
518	1
18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Behold	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
tree	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
moisture	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
thereof	1
that	1
the	1
root	1
thereof	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
strength	1

because	1
of	1
the	1
much	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
thereof	1
the	1
wild	1

have	1
brought	1
forth	1
tame	1

Now	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
grafted	1
in	1
these	1
branches	1
the	1
tree	1
thereof	1
would	1
have	1
perished	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
shall	1
lay	1
up	1
much	1
fruit	1
which	1
the	1
tree	1
thereof	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1

the	1

I	1

Come	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

forth	1
whither	1
the	1

had	1
hid	1
the	1

unto	1
the	1

Behold	1

he	1

the	1
first	1
that	1

was	1
good	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Take	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
it	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
for	1
behold	1
said	1
he	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
nourished	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
521	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master	1
How	1
comest	1
thou	1
hither	1
to	1
plant	1
this	1
tree	1
or	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
poorest	1
spot	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Counsel	1
me	1
not	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
spot	1
of	1
ground	1
wherefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
it	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
523	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
Look	1
hither	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
planted	1
another	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
also	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
this	1
spot	1
of	1
ground	1
was	1
poorer	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
tree	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
it	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit	1
therefore	1
gather	1
it	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
it	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
Jacob	1
524	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
again	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
Look	1
hither	1
and	1
behold	1
another	1
branch	1
also	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
planted	1
behold	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
it	1
also	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
525	1
25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Look	1
hither	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
last	1
Behold	1
this	1
have	1
I	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
spot	1
of	1
ground	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
it	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
tame	1
fruit	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
wild	1
fruit	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
this	1
tree	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
others	1
Jacob	1
526	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Pluck	1
off	1
the	1
branches	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
brought	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
Jacob	1
527	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Let	1
us	1
prune	1
it	1
and	1
dig	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
nourish	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
Jacob	1
528	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
did	1
nourish	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
529	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
Come	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
labor	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
draweth	1
near	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
soon	1
cometh	1
wherefore	1
I	1
must	1
lay	1
up	1
fruit	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
Jacob	1
530	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
whose	1
natural	1
branches	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
off	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
had	1
been	1
grafted	1
in	1
and	1
behold	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
fruit	1
did	1
cumber	1
the	1
tree	1
Jacob	1
531	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
did	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
every	1
sort	1
according	1
to	1
its	1
number	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
Behold	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
have	1
we	1
nourished	1
this	1
tree	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
unto	1
myself	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
much	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
532	1
32	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
are	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
bad	1
fruit	1
and	1
it	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
our	1
labor	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
this	1
tree	1
Jacob	1
533	1
33	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
tree	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
again	1
good	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
Jacob	1
534	1
34	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master	1
Behold	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
graft	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
olivetree	1
they	1
have	1
nourished	1
the	1
roots	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
perished	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
yet	1
good	1
Jacob	1
535	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
The	1
tree	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing	1
and	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
profit	1
me	1
nothing	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
536	1
36	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
roots	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
purpose	1
I	1
have	1
preserved	1
them	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
much	1
strength	1
they	1
have	1
hitherto	1
brought	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
good	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
537	1
37	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
have	1
grown	1
and	1
have	1
overrun	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
much	1
evil	1
fruit	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
so	1
much	1
evil	1
fruit	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
that	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
perish	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
soon	1
become	1
ripened	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
except	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
preserve	1
it	1
Jacob	1
538	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
nethermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
behold	1
if	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
have	1
also	1
brought	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
539	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
nethermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
had	1
become	1
corrupt	1
also	1
yea	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
become	1
corrupt	1
Jacob	1
540	1
40	1
And	1
the	1
wild	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
had	1
overcome	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
even	1
that	1
the	1
branch	1
had	1
withered	1
away	1
and	1
died	1
Jacob	1
541	1
41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
wept	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
for	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
542	1
42	1
Behold	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
these	1
had	1
become	1
corrupted	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
which	1
have	1
once	1
brought	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
have	1
also	1
become	1
corrupted	1
and	1
now	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
are	1
good	1
for	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
Jacob	1
543	1
43	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
last	1
whose	1
branch	1
hath	1
withered	1
away	1
I	1
did	1
plant	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
spot	1
of	1
ground	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
choice	1
unto	1
me	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
544	1
44	1
And	1
thou	1
beheldest	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
cut	1
down	1
that	1
which	1
cumbered	1
this	1
spot	1
of	1
ground	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
plant	1
this	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
thereof	1
Jacob	1
545	1
45	1
And	1
thou	1
beheldest	1
that	1
a	1
part	1
thereof	1
brought	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
thereof	1
brought	1
forth	1
wild	1
fruit	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
plucked	1
not	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
good	1
branch	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
withered	1
away	1
Jacob	1
546	1
46	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
care	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
taken	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
the	1
trees	1
thereof	1
have	1
become	1
corrupted	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
forth	1
no	1
good	1
fruit	1
and	1
these	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
preserve	1
to	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
wild	1
olivetree	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
no	1
worth	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
them	1
Jacob	1
547	1
47	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Have	1
I	1
slackened	1
mine	1
hand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
nourished	1
it	1
Nay	1
I	1
have	1
nourished	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
pruned	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
dunged	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
And	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hew	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
burned	1
Who	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
has	1
corrupted	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
548	1
48	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyardhave	1
not	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
overcome	1
the	1
roots	1
which	1
are	1
good	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
branches	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
behold	1
they	1
grew	1
faster	1
than	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
taking	1
strength	1
unto	1
themselves	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
thy	1
vineyard	1
have	1
become	1
corrupted	1
Jacob	1
549	1
49	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
and	1
hew	1
down	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
cumber	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
more	1
for	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
550	1
50	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
Spare	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
Jacob	1
551	1
51	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
for	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
552	1
52	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
these	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
nethermost	1
parts	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
graft	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
tree	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
pluck	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
those	1
branches	1
whose	1
fruit	1
is	1
most	1
bitter	1
and	1
graft	1
in	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
thereof	1
Jacob	1
553	1
53	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
the	1
tree	1
may	1
not	1
perish	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
unto	1
myself	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
purpose	1
Jacob	1
554	1
54	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
I	1
planted	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
would	1
are	1
yet	1
alive	1
wherefore	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
them	1
also	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
purpose	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
this	1
tree	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
graft	1
them	1
in	1
unto	1
them	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
graft	1
in	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
tree	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
the	1
roots	1
also	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
yet	1
have	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
555	1
55	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
tree	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
wild	1
and	1
grafted	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
natural	1
trees	1
which	1
also	1
had	1
become	1
wild	1
Jacob	1
556	1
56	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
trees	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
wild	1
and	1
grafted	1
into	1
their	1
mother	1
tree	1
Jacob	1
557	1
57	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant	1
Pluck	1
not	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
most	1
bitter	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
graft	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
Jacob	1
558	1
58	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
nourish	1
again	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
trim	1
up	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
pluck	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
those	1
branches	1
which	1
are	1
ripened	1
that	1
must	1
perish	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
Jacob	1
559	1
59	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
may	1
take	1
strength	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
goodness	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
may	1
overcome	1
the	1
evil	1
Jacob	1
560	1
60	1
And	1
because	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
and	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
grafted	1
in	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
again	1
into	1
their	1
mother	1
tree	1
and	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
tree	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
again	1
good	1
fruit	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
joy	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
perhaps	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
roots	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
561	1
61	1
Wherefore	1
go	1
to	1
and	1
call	1
servants	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
labor	1
diligently	1
with	1
our	1
might	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
again	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
which	1
natural	1
fruit	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
fruit	1
Jacob	1
562	1
62	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
and	1
labor	1
with	1
our	1
might	1
this	1
last	1
time	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
end	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
prune	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
563	1
63	1
Graft	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
first	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
may	1
be	1

and	1
dig	1
about	1
the	1
trees	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
the	1

the	1

that	1

be	1
nourished	1
once	1
again	1
for	1
the	1

Jacob	1
564	1
64	1
Wherefore	1
dig	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
prune	1
them	1
and	1
dung	1
them	1
once	1
more	1
for	1
the	1

for	1
the	1

And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
so	1
that	1
these	1
last	1
grafts	1
shall	1
grow	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
grow	1
Jacob	1
565	1
65	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
grow	1
ye	1
shall	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
branches	1
which	1
bring	1
forth	1
bitter	1
fruit	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
size	1
thereof	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
bad	1
thereof	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
lest	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
should	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
the	1
graft	1
and	1
the	1
graft	1
thereof	1
shall	1
perish	1
and	1
I	1
lose	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
566	1
66	1
For	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
bad	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
good	1
shall	1
grow	1
that	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
may	1
be	1
equal	1
in	1
strength	1
until	1
the	1
good	1
shall	1
overcome	1
the	1
bad	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
they	1
cumber	1
not	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
sweep	1
away	1
the	1
bad	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
567	1
67	1
And	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
tree	1
will	1
I	1
graft	1
in	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
natural	1
tree	1
Jacob	1
568	1
68	1
And	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
tree	1
will	1
I	1
graft	1
into	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
together	1
again	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
Jacob	1
569	1
69	1
And	1
the	1
bad	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
away	1
yea	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
for	1
behold	1
only	1
this	1
once	1
will	1
I	1
prune	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
570	1
70	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
sent	1
his	1
servant	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
went	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
and	1
brought	1
other	1
servants	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
few	1
Jacob	1
571	1
71	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Go	1
to	1
and	1
labor	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
with	1
your	1
might	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
nourish	1
my	1
vineyard	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
season	1
speedily	1
cometh	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
labor	1
with	1
your	1
might	1
with	1
me	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
lay	1
up	1
unto	1
myself	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
will	1
soon	1
come	1
Jacob	1
572	1
72	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
servants	1
did	1
go	1
and	1
labor	1
with	1
their	1
mights	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
labored	1
also	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
obey	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
Jacob	1
573	1
73	1
And	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
the	1
natural	1
branches	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
and	1
thrive	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
branches	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
plucked	1
off	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
away	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
equal	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
thereof	1
Jacob	1
574	1
74	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
labored	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
bad	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
preserved	1
unto	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
trees	1
had	1
become	1
again	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
like	1
unto	1
one	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
fruits	1
were	1
equal	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
had	1
preserved	1
unto	1
himself	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
which	1
was	1
most	1
precious	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Jacob	1
575	1
75	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
fruit	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
vineyard	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
corrupt	1
he	1
called	1
up	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
for	1
this	1
last	1
time	1
have	1
we	1
nourished	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
thou	1
beholdest	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
even	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
And	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
for	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
diligent	1
in	1
laboring	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
the	1
natural	1
fruit	1
that	1
my	1
vineyard	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
corrupted	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
is	1
cast	1
away	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
joy	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
Jacob	1
576	1
76	1
For	1
behold	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
against	1
the	1
season	1
which	1
speedily	1
cometh	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
nourished	1
my	1
vineyard	1
and	1
pruned	1
it	1
and	1
dug	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
dunged	1
it	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
up	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
Jacob	1
577	1
77	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
that	1
evil	1
fruit	1
shall	1
again	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
vineyard	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
I	1
preserve	1
unto	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
away	1
into	1
its	1

And	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
season	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
my	1

Jacob	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
as	1
I	1

unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1

this	1

my	1
prophecythat	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
this	1

concerning	1
the	1

of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1

them	1
unto	1
a	1

surely	1
come	1
to	1

Jacob	1

And	1
the	1

that	1

shall	1
set	1
his	1

the	1

that	1

go	1
forth	1
in	1

after	1
that	1

Jacob	1

And	1
how	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1

diligently	1
in	1

And	1
how	1

is	1
our	1

unto	1

for	1
he	1
remembereth	1
the	1

are	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
a	1
gainsaying	1
people	1
but	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
will	1
not	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
65	1
5	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
beseech	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
words	1
of	1
soberness	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
repent	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
full	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
cleave	1
unto	1
God	1
as	1
he	1
cleaveth	1
unto	1
you	1
And	1
while	1
his	1
arm	1
of	1
mercy	1
is	1
extended	1
towards	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
Jacob	1
66	1
6	1
Yea	1
today	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
for	1
why	1
will	1
ye	1
die	1
Jacob	1
67	1
7	1
For	1
behold	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
bring	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
Jacob	1
68	1
8	1
Behold	1
will	1
ye	1
reject	1
these	1
words	1
Will	1
ye	1
reject	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
will	1
ye	1
reject	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
Christ	1
after	1
so	1
many	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
him	1
and	1
deny	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
quench	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
mock	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
laid	1
for	1
you	1
Jacob	1
69	1
9	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
redemption	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
stand	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
awful	1
guilt	1
before	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
Jacob	1
610	1
10	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
justice	1
for	1
justice	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied	1
ye	1
must	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
that	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
whose	1
flames	1
are	1
unquenchable	1
and	1
whose	1
smoke	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
which	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
is	1
endless	1
torment	1
Jacob	1
611	1
11	1
O	1
then	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
repent	1
ye	1
and	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate	1
and	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
is	1
narrow	1
until	1
ye	1
shall	1
obtain	1
eternal	1
life	1
Jacob	1
612	1
12	1
O	1
be	1
wise	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
more	1
Jacob	1
613	1
13	1
Finally	1
I	1
bid	1
you	1
farewell	1
until	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
pleasing	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
bar	1
striketh	1
the	1
wicked	1
with	1
awful	1
dread	1
and	1
fear	1
Amen	1

Jacob	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
some	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Sherem	1
Jacob	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
Christ	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
flattering	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
overthrow	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jacob	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
labored	1
diligently	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
lead	1
away	1
many	1
hearts	1
and	1
he	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
Jacob	1
had	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
he	1
sought	1
much	1
opportunity	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
Jacob	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
wherefore	1
he	1
could	1
use	1
much	1
flattery	1
and	1
much	1
power	1
of	1
speech	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Jacob	1
75	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
hope	1
to	1
shake	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
faith	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
many	1
revelations	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
I	1
truly	1
had	1
seen	1
angels	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
And	1
also	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
very	1
word	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
wherefore	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
shaken	1
Jacob	1
76	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
did	1
he	1
speak	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Brother	1
Jacob	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
much	1
opportunity	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
and	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
about	1
much	1
preaching	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
call	1
the	1
gospel	1
or	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jacob	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
led	1
away	1
much	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
keep	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
and	1
convert	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
into	1
the	1
worship	1
of	1
a	1
being	1
which	1
ye	1
say	1
shall	1
come	1
many	1
hundred	1
years	1
hence	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
Sherem	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
blasphemy	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
for	1
he	1
cannot	1
tell	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
Sherem	1
contend	1
against	1
me	1
Jacob	1
78	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
poured	1
in	1
his	1
Spirit	1
into	1
my	1
soul	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
confound	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
Jacob	1
79	1
9	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Deniest	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ	1
who	1
shall	1
come	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
If	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
Christ	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
deny	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
Christ	1
neither	1
has	1
been	1
nor	1
ever	1
will	1
be	1
Jacob	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
the	1
scriptures	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
Jacob	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Then	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
truly	1
testify	1
of	1
Christ	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
written	1
nor	1
prophesied	1
save	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
this	1
Christ	1
Jacob	1
712	1
12	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
allit	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
and	1
it	1
also	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
if	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
atonement	1
made	1
all	1
mankind	1
must	1
be	1
lost	1
Jacob	1
713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Show	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
by	1
this	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
Jacob	1
714	1
14	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
tempt	1
God	1
to	1
show	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
sign	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
Yet	1
thou	1
wilt	1
deny	1
it	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Nevertheless	1
not	1
my	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
if	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
let	1
that	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
power	1
both	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
And	1
thy	1
will	1
O	1
Lord	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
not	1
mine	1
Jacob	1
715	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
Jacob	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nourished	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
Jacob	1
716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Gather	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
wherefore	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
before	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
Jacob	1
717	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
the	1
multitude	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
plainly	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
denied	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taught	1
them	1
and	1
confessed	1
the	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
the	1
ministering	1
of	1
angels	1
Jacob	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
plainly	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
of	1
eternity	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
punishment	1
Jacob	1
719	1
19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
the	1
unpardonable	1
sin	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
lied	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
I	1
denied	1
the	1
Christ	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
believed	1
the	1
scriptures	1
and	1
they	1
truly	1
testify	1
of	1
him	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
thus	1
lied	1
unto	1
God	1
I	1
greatly	1
fear	1
lest	1
my	1
case	1
shall	1
be	1
awful	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
unto	1
God	1
Jacob	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
Jacob	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
multitude	1
had	1
witnessed	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
overcome	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Jacob	1
722	1
22	1
Now	1
this	1
thing	1
was	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
me	1
Jacob	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
requested	1
it	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
heaven	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
my	1
cry	1
and	1
answered	1
my	1
prayer	1
Jacob	1
723	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
restored	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
and	1
hearkened	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
wicked	1
man	1
Jacob	1
724	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
means	1
were	1
devised	1
to	1
reclaim	1
and	1
restore	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
vain	1
for	1
they	1
delighted	1
in	1
wars	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
an	1
eternal	1
hatred	1
against	1
us	1
their	1
brethren	1
And	1
they	1
sought	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
arms	1
to	1
destroy	1
us	1
continually	1
Jacob	1
725	1
25	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
fortify	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
might	1
trusting	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
their	1
salvation	1
wherefore	1
they	1
became	1
as	1
yet	1
conquerors	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Jacob	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Jacob	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
being	1
kept	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
wherefore	1
I	1
conclude	1
this	1
record	1
declaring	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
knowledge	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
passed	1
away	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
lives	1
passed	1
away	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
dream	1
we	1
being	1
a	1
lonesome	1
and	1
a	1
solemn	1
people	1
wanderers	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
born	1
in	1
tribulation	1
in	1
a	1
wilderness	1
and	1
hated	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
which	1
caused	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
wherefore	1
we	1
did	1
mourn	1
out	1
our	1
days	1
Jacob	1
727	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
soon	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
grave	1
wherefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
Enos	1
Take	1
these	1
plates	1
And	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
my	1
brother	1
Nephi	1
had	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
obedience	1
unto	1
the	1
commands	1
And	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
writing	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
which	1
writing	1
has	1
been	1
small	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
reader	1
I	1
bid	1
farewell	1
hoping	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
may	1
read	1
my	1
words	1
Brethren	1
adieu	1
THE	1
BOOK	1
OF	1
ENOS	1
Enos	1
11	1
1	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Enos	1
knowing	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
manfor	1
he	1
taught	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
language	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
nurture	1
and	1
admonition	1
of	1
the	1
Lordand	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
it	1
Enos	1
12	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
wrestle	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
God	1
before	1
I	1
received	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
Enos	1
13	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
hunt	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
speak	1
concerning	1
eternal	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
sunk	1
deep	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
Enos	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
my	1
soul	1
hungered	1
and	1
I	1
kneeled	1
down	1
before	1
my	1
Maker	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
mighty	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
soul	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
did	1
I	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
yea	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
I	1
did	1
still	1
raise	1
my	1
voice	1
high	1
that	1
it	1
reached	1
the	1
heavens	1
Enos	1
15	1
5	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Enos	1
thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
thee	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blessed	1
Enos	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
I	1
Enos	1
knew	1
that	1
God	1
could	1
not	1
lie	1
wherefore	1
my	1
guilt	1
was	1
swept	1
away	1
Enos	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
Lord	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
done	1
Enos	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Because	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
never	1
before	1
heard	1
nor	1
seen	1
And	1
many	1
years	1
pass	1
away	1
before	1
he	1
shall	1
manifest	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
wherefore	1
go	1
to	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole	1
Enos	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
wherefore	1
I	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
whole	1
soul	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
them	1
Enos	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
struggling	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
again	1
saying	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
thy	1
brethren	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
diligence	1
in	1
keeping	1
my	1
commandments	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
holy	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
curse	1
it	1
not	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
iniquity	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
thy	1
brethren	1
according	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
their	1
transgressions	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
down	1
with	1
sorrow	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
heads	1
Enos	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
after	1
I	1
Enos	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
my	1
faith	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
unshaken	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
many	1
long	1
strugglings	1
for	1
my	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Enos	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
prayed	1
and	1
labored	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
unto	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
desires	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
Enos	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
desire	1
which	1
I	1
desired	1
of	1
himthat	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
and	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
would	1
preserve	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
arm	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
forth	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
perhaps	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
salvation	1
Enos	1
114	1
14	1
For	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
our	1
strugglings	1
were	1
vain	1
in	1
restoring	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
faith	1
And	1
they	1
swore	1
in	1
their	1
wrath	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
they	1
would	1
destroy	1
our	1
records	1
and	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
Enos	1
115	1
15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
preserve	1
our	1
records	1
I	1
cried	1
unto	1
him	1
continually	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Whatsoever	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
faith	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
it	1
Enos	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
I	1
had	1
faith	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
preserve	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
he	1
covenanted	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
Enos	1
117	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
Enos	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
wherefore	1
my	1
soul	1
did	1
rest	1
Enos	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
also	1
required	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
thing	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
for	1
their	1
faith	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
thine	1
Enos	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Enos	1
went	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
prophesying	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
testifying	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
Enos	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
seek	1
diligently	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
unto	1
the	1
true	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
But	1
our	1
labors	1
were	1
vain	1
their	1
hatred	1
was	1
fixed	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
their	1
evil	1
nature	1
that	1
they	1
became	1
wild	1
and	1
ferocious	1
and	1
a	1
bloodthirsty	1
people	1
full	1
of	1
idolatry	1
and	1
filthiness	1
feeding	1
upon	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tents	1
and	1
wandering	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
skin	1
girdle	1
about	1
their	1
loins	1
and	1
their	1
heads	1
shaven	1
and	1
their	1
skill	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cimeter	1
and	1
the	1
ax	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
eat	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
was	1
raw	1
meat	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
seeking	1
to	1
destroy	1
us	1
Enos	1
121	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
till	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
raise	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
of	1
fruit	1
and	1
flocks	1
of	1
herds	1
and	1
flocks	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
cattle	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
goats	1
and	1
wild	1
goats	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
horses	1
Enos	1
122	1
22	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
many	1
prophets	1
among	1
us	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
hard	1
to	1
understand	1
Enos	1
123	1
23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
was	1
exceeding	1
harshness	1
preaching	1
and	1
prophesying	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
and	1
destructions	1
and	1
continually	1
reminding	1
them	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
eternity	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
thingsstirring	1
them	1
up	1
continually	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
short	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech	1
would	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
going	1
down	1
speedily	1
to	1
destruction	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
do	1
I	1
write	1
concerning	1
them	1
Enos	1
124	1
24	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
days	1
Enos	1
125	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
Enos	1
126	1
26	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
soon	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
grave	1
having	1
been	1
wrought	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
preach	1
and	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
days	1
and	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it	1
above	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Enos	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
soon	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
my	1
Redeemer	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
I	1
shall	1
rest	1
And	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
mortal	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
immortality	1
and	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
him	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
Come	1
unto	1
me	1
ye	1
blessed	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
mansions	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
Amen	1
THE	1
BOOK	1
OF	1
JAROM	1
Jarom	1
11	1
1	1
Now	1
behold	1
I	1
Jarom	1
write	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Enos	1
that	1
our	1
genealogy	1
may	1
be	1
kept	1
Jarom	1
12	1
2	1
And	1
as	1
these	1
plates	1
are	1
small	1
and	1
as	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
written	1
for	1
the	1
intent	1
of	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
wherefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
little	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
prophesying	1
nor	1
of	1
my	1
revelations	1
For	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
write	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
written	1
For	1
have	1
not	1
they	1
revealed	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
salvation	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
and	1
this	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
Jarom	1
13	1
3	1
Behold	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
much	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
the	1
deafness	1
of	1
their	1
ears	1
and	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
the	1
stiffness	1
of	1
their	1
necks	1
nevertheless	1
God	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
swept	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Jarom	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
among	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
many	1
revelations	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
stiffnecked	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
not	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
have	1
faith	1
have	1
communion	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
which	1
maketh	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
Jarom	1
15	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
two	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
had	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
They	1
observed	1
to	1
keep	1

law	1
of	1

and	1
the	1
sabbath	1

holy	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
they	1
profaned	1
not	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
blaspheme	1
And	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
strict	1
Jarom	1
16	1

And	1
they	1
were	1
scattered	1
upon	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
also	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
were	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
loved	1
murder	1
and	1
would	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
beasts	1
Jarom	1
17	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
many	1
times	1
against	1
us	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
battle	1
But	1
our	1
kings	1
and	1
our	1
leaders	1
were	1
mighty	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
we	1
withstood	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
swept	1
them	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
fortify	1
our	1
cities	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
place	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
Jarom	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
we	1
multiplied	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
in	1
silver	1
and	1
in	1
precious	1
things	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
workmanship	1
of	1
wood	1
in	1
buildings	1
and	1
in	1
machinery	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
iron	1
and	1
copper	1
and	1
brass	1
and	1
steel	1
making	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
tools	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
to	1
till	1
the	1

and	1
weapons	1
of	1

the	1
sharp	1
pointed	1

and	1
the	1
quiver	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
javelin	1
and	1
all	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
Jarom	1
19	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
being	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
prosper	1
against	1
us	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
verified	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
saying	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Jarom	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
threaten	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
but	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Jarom	1
111	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
teachers	1
did	1
labor	1
diligently	1
exhorting	1
with	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
diligence	1
teaching	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
intent	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
persuading	1
them	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
unto	1
the	1
Messiah	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
already	1
was	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
they	1
teach	1
them	1
Jarom	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
they	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
being	1
destroyed	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
prick	1
their	1
hearts	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
continually	1
stirring	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Jarom	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
awayafter	1
the	1

And	1
I	1

not	1

I	1

1	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Omni	1
being	1
commanded	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
Jarom	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
write	1
somewhat	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
to	1
preserve	1
our	1
genealogy	1
Omni	1
12	1
2	1
Wherefore	1
in	1
my	1
days	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
fought	1
much	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
of	1
myself	1
am	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
statutes	1

the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
Omni	1
13	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
many	1
seasons	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
many	1

serious	1
war	1

Yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
two	1
hundred	1

eighty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1

kept	1
these	1

to	1
the	1

my	1

and	1
I	1
conferred	1
them	1
upon	1
my	1
son	1
Amaron	1
And	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
Omni	1
14	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
Amaron	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
write	1
which	1
are	1
few	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
my	1

Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
three	1
hundred	1

twenty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
destroyed	1
Omni	1
16	1
6	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1

kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
them	1
from	1
falling	1

the	1
hands	1

he	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
should	1
not	1

verified	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1

that	1
Inasmuch	1

Omni	1
17	1
7	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
visit	1
them	1
in	1
great	1
judgment	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
did	1
spare	1
the	1
righteous	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
perish	1
but	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1

Omni	1
18	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
I	1
did	1
deliver	1
the	1
plates	1
unto	1
my	1
brother	1
Chemish	1
Omni	1
19	1

Now	1
I	1
Chemish	1
write	1
what	1
few	1
things	1
I	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
book	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
last	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
that	1
he	1
wrote	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
unto	1
me	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
we	1
keep	1
the	1
records	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

our	1

And	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
Omni	1
110	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
Abinadom	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Chemish	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
much	1
war	1
and	1
contention	1
between	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
I	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
sword	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
my	1

Omni	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
engraven	1
upon	1
plates	1
which	1
is	1
had	1
by	1
the	1
kings	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
generations	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
no	1
revelation	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
neither	1
prophecy	1
wherefore	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
sufficient	1
is	1
written	1
And	1
I	1
make	1

Omni	1
112	1
12	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Amaleki	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abinadom	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
Mosiah	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
also	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Omni	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
many	1
preachings	1
and	1
prophesyings	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
admonished	1
continually	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Omni	1
114	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
rejoicing	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
also	1
Zarahemla	1
did	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
with	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
Omni	1
115	1
15	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
discovered	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon	1
Omni	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
were	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
across	1
the	1
great	1
waters	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
Mosiah	1
discovered	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
dwelt	1
there	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
Omni	1
117	1
17	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
discovered	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
numerous	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
many	1
wars	1
and	1
serious	1
contentions	1
and	1
had	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
their	1
language	1
had	1
become	1
corrupted	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
no	1
records	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
denied	1
the	1
being	1
of	1
their	1
Creator	1
and	1
Mosiah	1
nor	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
could	1
understand	1
them	1
Omni	1
118	1
18	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
taught	1
in	1
his	1
language	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
Zarahemla	1
gave	1
a	1
genealogy	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
these	1
plates	1
Omni	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
did	1
unite	1
together	1
and	1
Mosiah	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
Omni	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
stone	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
engravings	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
interpret	1
the	1
engravings	1
by	1
the	1
gift	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
Omni	1
121	1
21	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
one	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
And	1
Coriantumr	1
was	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
nine	1
moons	1
Omni	1
122	1
22	1
It	1
also	1
spake	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
concerning	1
his	1
fathers	1
And	1
his	1
first	1
parents	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
Lord	1
confounded	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
people	1

the	1
severity	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
judgments	1
which	1
are	1
just	1

their	1
bones	1
lay	1

Behold	1
I	1
Amaleki	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
his	1
son	1
reigneth	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Omni	1
124	1
24	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
a	1
serious	1
war	1
and	1
much	1
bloodshed	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
obtain	1
much	1
advantage	1
over	1
them	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
did	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Omni	1
125	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
seed	1
and	1
knowing	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
I	1
shall	1
deliver	1
up	1
these	1
plates	1
unto	1
him	1
exhorting	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
prophesying	1
and	1
in	1
revelations	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ministering	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
speaking	1
with	1
tongues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
interpreting	1
languages	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
good	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
save	1
it	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
devil	1
Omni	1
126	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
Christ	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
his	1
salvation	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
redemption	1
Yea	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
offer	1
your	1
whole	1
souls	1
as	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
continue	1
in	1
fasting	1

praying	1
and	1
endure	1
to	1
the	1
end	1

as	1
the	1

liveth	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
saved	1
Omni	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
Omni	1
128	1
28	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
their	1
leader	1
being	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
mighty	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
man	1
wherefore	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
contention	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
slain	1
save	1
fifty	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Omni	1
129	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
others	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
number	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Omni	1
130	1
30	1
And	1
I	1
Amaleki	1
had	1
a	1
brother	1
who	1
also	1
went	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
since	1
known	1
concerning	1
them	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
grave	1
and	1
these	1
plates	1
are	1
full	1

I	1

I	1
have	1

may	1

that	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
for	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
an	1

to	1
the	1

Amaleki	1
spake	1
I	1
searched	1
among	1
the	1

which	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
into	1
my	1

and	1
I	1
found	1

And	1
the	1

which	1
are	1

because	1
of	1
the	1

have	1

behold	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
these	1

contain	1
these	1
prophesyings	1

put	1

now	1
I	1

finish	1
out	1
my	1

I	1
take	1
from	1

up	1
these	1

I	1

be	1

now	1

gathered	1
together	1

were	1
for	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
these	1
plates	1
for	1
he	1
having	1
been	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
therefore	1
he	1
could	1
read	1
these	1
engravings	1
and	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
children	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
could	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
so	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
Mosiah	1
15	1
5	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
sons	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
read	1
and	1
understand	1
of	1
his	1
mysteries	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
commandments	1
always	1
before	1
our	1
eyes	1
that	1
even	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
know	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
or	1
even	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
taught	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
correct	1
Mosiah	1
16	1
6	1
O	1
my	1
sons	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
these	1
sayings	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
these	1
records	1
are	1
true	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
which	1
contain	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
until	1
now	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
them	1
before	1
our	1
eyes	1
Mosiah	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
sons	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
to	1
search	1
them	1
diligently	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
profit	1
thereby	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promises	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
made	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
did	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
teach	1
his	1
sons	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
Mosiah	1
19	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
teaching	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
he	1
waxed	1
old	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
very	1
soon	1
go	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
therefore	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
confer	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
Mosiah	1
110	1
10	1
Therefore	1
he	1
had	1
Mosiah	1
brought	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
My	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
this	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
who	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
unto	1
this	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
mouth	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
Mosiah	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
this	1
people	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
distinguished	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
diligent	1
people	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
blotted	1
out	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
transgression	1
Mosiah	1
113	1
13	1
Yea	1
and	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
this	1
highly	1
favored	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
and	1
become	1
a	1
wicked	1
and	1
an	1
adulterous	1
people	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
become	1
weak	1
like	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
preserve	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
matchless	1
and	1
marvelous	1
power	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
hitherto	1
preserved	1
our	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
114	1
14	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
extended	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
become	1
victims	1
to	1
their	1
hatred	1
Mosiah	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
sayings	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
charge	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Mosiah	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
moreover	1
he	1
also	1
gave	1
him	1
charge	1
concerning	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Laban	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
or	1
director	1
which	1
led	1
our	1
fathers	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
led	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
heed	1
and	1
diligence	1
which	1
they	1
gave	1
unto	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
117	1
17	1
Therefore	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
unfaithful	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
prosper	1
nor	1
progress	1
in	1
their	1
journey	1
but	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
and	1
incurred	1
the	1
displeasure	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
with	1
famine	1
and	1
sore	1
afflictions	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
Mosiah	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
went	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Mosiah	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
done	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
22	1
2	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
even	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
number	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
multiplied	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
waxed	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
23	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
their	1
flocks	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
offer	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
had	1
appointed	1
just	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
teachers	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
who	1
had	1
established	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
taught	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
love	1
towards	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
round	1
about	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
consisting	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
and	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
from	1
the	1
eldest	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
youngest	1
every	1
family	1
being	1
separate	1
one	1
from	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
temple	1
every	1
man	1
having	1
his	1
tent	1
with	1
the	1
door	1
thereof	1
towards	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
27	1
7	1
For	1
the	1
multitude	1
being	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
could	1
not	1
teach	1
them	1
all	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
tower	1
to	1
be	1
erected	1
that	1
thereby	1
his	1
people	1
might	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
28	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
also	1
receive	1
his	1
words	1
Mosiah	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
saying	1
My	1
brethren	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
have	1
assembled	1
yourselves	1
together	1
you	1
that	1
can	1
hear	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
hither	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
open	1
your	1
ears	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
hear	1
and	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
and	1
your	1
minds	1
that	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
unfolded	1
to	1
your	1
view	1
Mosiah	1
210	1
10	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
hither	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
fear	1
me	1
or	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
of	1
myself	1
am	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mortal	1
man	1
Mosiah	1
211	1
11	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
as	1
yourselves	1
subject	1
to	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
infirmities	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
mind	1
yet	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
chosen	1
by	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
consecrated	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
was	1
suffered	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
by	1
his	1
matchless	1
power	1
to	1
serve	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
might	1
mind	1
and	1
strength	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
granted	1
unto	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
212	1
12	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
suffered	1
to	1
spend	1
my	1
days	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
even	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
gold	1
nor	1
silver	1
nor	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
riches	1
of	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
213	1
13	1
Neither	1
have	1
I	1
suffered	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
confined	1
in	1
dungeons	1
nor	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
make	1
slaves	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
nor	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
murder	1
or	1
plunder	1
or	1
steal	1
or	1
commit	1
adultery	1
nor	1
even	1
have	1
I	1
suffered	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
commit	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
even	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
labored	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hands	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
serve	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
laden	1
with	1
taxes	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
nothing	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
which	1
was	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borneand	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day	1
Mosiah	1
215	1
15	1
Yet	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
boast	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
tell	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
thereby	1
I	1
might	1
accuse	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
answer	1
a	1
clear	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
this	1
day	1
Mosiah	1
216	1
16	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
spent	1
my	1
days	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
boast	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
that	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
fellow	1
beings	1
ye	1
are	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
218	1
18	1
Behold	1
ye	1
have	1
called	1
me	1
your	1
king	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
your	1
king	1
do	1
labor	1
to	1
serve	1
you	1
then	1
ought	1
not	1
ye	1
to	1
labor	1
to	1
serve	1
one	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
if	1
I	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
your	1
king	1
who	1
has	1
spent	1
his	1
days	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
and	1
yet	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God	1
do	1
merit	1
any	1
thanks	1
from	1
you	1
O	1
how	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
thank	1
your	1
heavenly	1
King	1
Mosiah	1
220	1
20	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
render	1
all	1
the	1
thanks	1
and	1
praise	1
which	1
your	1
whole	1
soul	1
has	1
power	1
to	1
possess	1
to	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
created	1
you	1
and	1
has	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
you	1
and	1
has	1
caused	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
rejoice	1
and	1
has	1
granted	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
221	1
21	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
should	1
serve	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
created	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
is	1
preserving	1
you	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
by	1
lending	1
you	1
breath	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live	1
and	1
move	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
will	1
and	1
even	1
supporting	1
you	1
from	1
one	1
moment	1
to	1
anotherI	1
say	1
if	1
ye	1
should	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
whole	1
souls	1
yet	1
ye	1
would	1
be	1
unprofitable	1
servants	1
Mosiah	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
behold	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
requires	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
promised	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
would	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
ye	1
should	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
doth	1
vary	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
he	1
doth	1
bless	1
you	1
and	1
prosper	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
223	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
hath	1
created	1
you	1
and	1
granted	1
unto	1
you	1
your	1
lives	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
indebted	1
unto	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
224	1
24	1
And	1
secondly	1
he	1
doth	1
require	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
for	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
he	1
doth	1
immediately	1
bless	1
you	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
paid	1
you	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
still	1
indebted	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
are	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
therefore	1
of	1
what	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
boast	1
Mosiah	1
225	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
can	1
ye	1
say	1
aught	1
of	1
yourselves	1
I	1
answer	1
you	1
Nay	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
even	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
yet	1
ye	1
were	1
created	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
but	1
behold	1
it	1
belongeth	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
created	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
226	1
26	1
And	1
I	1
even	1
I	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
your	1
king	1
am	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
And	1
ye	1
behold	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
yield	1
up	1
this	1
mortal	1
frame	1
to	1
its	1
mother	1
earth	1
Mosiah	1
227	1
27	1
Therefore	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
served	1
you	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
assemble	1
yourselves	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
blameless	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
blood	1
should	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
stand	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
concerning	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
228	1
28	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
assemble	1
yourselves	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rid	1
my	1
garments	1
of	1
your	1
blood	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
grave	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
go	1
down	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
my	1
immortal	1
spirit	1
may	1
join	1
the	1
choirs	1
above	1
in	1
singing	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
a	1
just	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
229	1
29	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
assemble	1
yourselves	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
your	1
teacher	1
nor	1
your	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
230	1
30	1
For	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
whole	1
frame	1
doth	1
tremble	1
exceedingly	1
while	1
attempting	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
doth	1
support	1
me	1
and	1
hath	1
suffered	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
Mosiah	1
is	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
231	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
hitherto	1
done	1
As	1
ye	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
have	1
prospered	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
even	1
so	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
or	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
him	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
232	1
32	1
But	1
O	1
my	1
people	1
beware	1
lest	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
contentions	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
ye	1
list	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
Mosiah	1
Mosiah	1
233	1
33	1
For	1
behold	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
wo	1
pronounced	1
upon	1
him	1
who	1
listeth	1
to	1
obey	1
that	1
spirit	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
listeth	1
to	1
obey	1
him	1
and	1
remaineth	1
and	1
dieth	1
in	1
his	1
sins	1
the	1
same	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
for	1
he	1
receiveth	1
for	1
his	1
wages	1
an	1
everlasting	1
punishment	1
having	1
transgressed	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
knowledge	1
Mosiah	1
234	1
34	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
little	1
children	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
taught	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
what	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
eternally	1
indebted	1
to	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
to	1
render	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
and	1
are	1
and	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
concerning	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
contain	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
Mosiah	1
235	1
35	1
And	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
until	1
now	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
they	1
spake	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
commanded	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
Mosiah	1
236	1
36	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
if	1
ye	1
should	1
transgress	1
and	1
go	1
contrary	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
withdraw	1
yourselves	1
from	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you	1
to	1
guide	1
you	1
in	1
wisdoms	1
paths	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blessed	1
prospered	1
and	1
preserved	1
Mosiah	1
237	1
37	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this	1
the	1
same	1
cometh	1
out	1
in	1
open	1
rebellion	1
against	1
God	1
therefore	1
he	1
listeth	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
and	1
becometh	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
all	1
righteousness	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
unholy	1
temples	1
Mosiah	1
238	1
38	1
Therefore	1
if	1
that	1
man	1
repenteth	1
not	1
and	1
remaineth	1
and	1
dieth	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
divine	1
justice	1
do	1
awaken	1
his	1
immortal	1
soul	1
to	1
a	1
lively	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guilt	1
which	1
doth	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
shrink	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
doth	1
fill	1
his	1
breast	1
with	1
guilt	1
and	1
pain	1
and	1
anguish	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
an	1
unquenchable	1
fire	1
whose	1
flame	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
Mosiah	1
239	1
39	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
mercy	1
hath	1
no	1
claim	1
on	1
that	1
man	1
therefore	1
his	1
final	1
doom	1
is	1
to	1
endure	1
a	1
neverending	1
torment	1
Mosiah	1
240	1
40	1
O	1
all	1
ye	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
ye	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
you	1
little	1
children	1
who	1
can	1
understand	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
plainly	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
understand	1
I	1
pray	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
awake	1
to	1
a	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
awful	1
situation	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
transgression	1
Mosiah	1
241	1
41	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
consider	1
on	1
the	1
blessed	1
and	1
happy	1
state	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
blessed	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
both	1
temporal	1
and	1
spiritual	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
hold	1
out	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
are	1
received	1
into	1
heaven	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
with	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
neverending	1
happiness	1
O	1
remember	1
remember	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
Mosiah	1
3	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Mosiah	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
again	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
call	1
your	1
attention	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
more	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
things	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Mosiah	1
32	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
you	1
are	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
God	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Awake	1
and	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
33	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Awake	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
34	1
4	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayers	1
and	1
hath	1
judged	1
of	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
and	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1

For	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
distant	1
that	1
with	1
power	1
the	1
Lord	1

who	1
reigneth	1
who	1
was	1

is	1
from	1
all	1
eternity	1
to	1
all	1
eternity	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1

shall	1
go	1
forth	1
amongst	1
men	1
working	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
such	1
as	1
healing	1
the	1
sick	1
raising	1

the	1

curing	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
diseases	1
Mosiah	1
36	1

And	1
he	1
shall	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
or	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
37	1

And	1
lo	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
temptations	1
and	1
pain	1
of	1
body	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
fatigue	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
man	1
can	1
suffer	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
behold	1
blood	1
cometh	1
from	1
every	1
pore	1
so	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
anguish	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1

earth	1
the	1

his	1

shall	1
be	1
called	1
Mary	1
Mosiah	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
lo	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
that	1
salvation	1
might	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
through	1
faith	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
even	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
they	1
shall	1
consider	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
devil	1
and	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him	1
and	1
shall	1
crucify	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
standeth	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
behold	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
that	1
a	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
might	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
311	1
11	1
For	1
behold	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
blood	1
atoneth	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Adam	1
who	1
have	1
died	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
concerning	1
them	1
or	1
who	1
have	1
ignorantly	1
sinned	1
Mosiah	1
312	1
12	1
But	1
wo	1
wo	1
unto	1
him	1
who	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
rebelleth	1
against	1
God	1
For	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
to	1
none	1
such	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
declare	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
every	1
kindred	1
nation	1
and	1
tongue	1
that	1
thereby	1
whosoever	1
should	1
believe	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
come	1
the	1
same	1
might	1
receive	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
even	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
come	1
among	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
314	1
14	1
Yet	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
appointed	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
law	1
even	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1
315	1
15	1
And	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
types	1
and	1
shadows	1
showed	1
he	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
also	1
holy	1
prophets	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
availeth	1
nothing	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
his	1
blood	1
Mosiah	1
316	1
16	1
And	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
little	1
children	1
could	1
sin	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
saved	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
blessed	1
for	1
behold	1
as	1
in	1
Adam	1
or	1
by	1
nature	1
they	1
fall	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ	1
atoneth	1
for	1
their	1
sins	1
Mosiah	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
other	1
name	1
given	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
nor	1
means	1
whereby	1
salvation	1
can	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
only	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
Omnipotent	1
Mosiah	1
318	1
18	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
judgeth	1
and	1
his	1
judgment	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
the	1
infant	1
perisheth	1
not	1
that	1
dieth	1
in	1
his	1
infancy	1
but	1
men	1
drink	1
damnation	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
souls	1
except	1
they	1
humble	1
themselves	1
and	1
become	1
as	1
little	1
children	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
salvation	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
atoning	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
Omnipotent	1
Mosiah	1
319	1
19	1
For	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
is	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Adam	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
unless	1
he	1
yields	1
to	1
the	1
enticings	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
and	1
putteth	1
off	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
and	1
becometh	1
a	1
saint	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
becometh	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
submissive	1
meek	1
humble	1
patient	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
willing	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
seeth	1
fit	1
to	1
inflict	1
upon	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
doth	1
submit	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
Mosiah	1
320	1
20	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
when	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Savior	1
shall	1
spread	1
throughout	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
behold	1
when	1
that	1
time	1
cometh	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
blameless	1
before	1
God	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
little	1
children	1
only	1
through	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Omnipotent	1
Mosiah	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
taught	1
thy	1
people	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
thee	1
even	1
then	1
are	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
blameless	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
only	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee	1
Mosiah	1
323	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
They	1
shall	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
bright	1
testimony	1
against	1
this	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
judgment	1
day	1
whereof	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
Mosiah	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
they	1
are	1
consigned	1
to	1
an	1
awful	1
view	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
guilt	1
and	1
abominations	1
which	1
doth	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
shrink	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
endless	1
torment	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
return	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
drunk	1
damnation	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
souls	1
Mosiah	1
326	1
26	1
Therefore	1
they	1
have	1
drunk	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
justice	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
deny	1
unto	1
them	1
than	1
it	1
could	1
deny	1
that	1
Adam	1
should	1
fall	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
therefore	1
mercy	1
could	1
have	1
claim	1
on	1
them	1
no	1
more	1
forever	1
Mosiah	1
327	1
27	1
And	1
their	1
torment	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
whose	1
flames	1
are	1
unquenchable	1
and	1
whose	1
smoke	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
me	1
Amen	1
Mosiah	1

Chapter	1

Mosiah	1
41	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
42	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
viewed	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
carnal	1
state	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
cried	1
aloud	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
saying	1
O	1
have	1
mercy	1
and	1
apply	1
the	1
atoning	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
receive	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
our	1
sins	1
and	1
our	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
purified	1
for	1
we	1
believe	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
created	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
who	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
having	1
peace	1
of	1
conscience	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
44	1
4	1
And	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
again	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
My	1
friends	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
my	1
kindred	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
I	1
would	1
again	1
call	1
your	1
attention	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
hear	1
and	1
understand	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
45	1
5	1
For	1
behold	1
if	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
has	1
awakened	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
your	1
nothingness	1
and	1
your	1
worthless	1
and	1
fallen	1
state	1
Mosiah	1
46	1
6	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
matchless	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
wisdom	1
and	1
his	1
patience	1
and	1
his	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
atonement	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
thereby	1
salvation	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
should	1
put	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
diligent	1
in	1
keeping	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
mortal	1
body	1
Mosiah	1
47	1
7	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
receiveth	1
salvation	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
all	1
mankind	1
which	1
ever	1
were	1
since	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Adam	1
or	1
who	1
are	1
or	1
who	1
ever	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Mosiah	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
means	1
whereby	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
salvation	1
save	1
this	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
neither	1
are	1
there	1
any	1
conditions	1
whereby	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
except	1
the	1
conditions	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
49	1
9	1
Believe	1
in	1
God	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
both	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
all	1
power	1
both	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
believe	1
that	1
man	1
doth	1
not	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
can	1
comprehend	1
Mosiah	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
again	1
believe	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
repent	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
forsake	1
them	1
and	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
ask	1
in	1
sincerity	1
of	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
forgive	1
you	1
and	1
now	1
if	1
you	1
believe	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
411	1
11	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
which	1
causeth	1
such	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
your	1
souls	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
and	1
always	1
retain	1
in	1
remembrance	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
your	1
own	1
nothingness	1
and	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
you	1
unworthy	1
creatures	1
and	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
humility	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
daily	1
and	1
standing	1
steadfastly	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
Mosiah	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
ye	1
shall	1
always	1
rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
always	1
retain	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
grow	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
created	1
you	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
Mosiah	1
413	1
13	1
And	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
injure	1
one	1
another	1
but	1
to	1
live	1
peaceably	1
and	1
to	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
his	1
due	1
Mosiah	1
414	1
14	1
And	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
your	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
hungry	1
or	1
naked	1
neither	1
will	1
ye	1
suffer	1
that	1
they	1
transgress	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
fight	1
and	1
quarrel	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
sin	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
he	1
being	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
all	1
righteousness	1
Mosiah	1
415	1
15	1
But	1
ye	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness	1
ye	1
will	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
one	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
also	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
will	1
succor	1
those	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
your	1
succor	1
ye	1
will	1
administer	1
of	1
your	1
substance	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
standeth	1
in	1
need	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
the	1
beggar	1
putteth	1
up	1
his	1
petition	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
turn	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
perish	1
Mosiah	1
417	1
17	1
Perhaps	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
The	1
man	1
has	1
brought	1
upon	1
himself	1
his	1
misery	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
stay	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
food	1
nor	1
impart	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
substance	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
suffer	1
for	1
his	1
punishments	1
are	1
just	1
Mosiah	1
418	1
18	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
O	1
man	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
this	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
great	1
cause	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
except	1
he	1
repenteth	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
he	1
perisheth	1
forever	1
and	1
hath	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
419	1
19	1
For	1
behold	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
all	1
beggars	1
Do	1
we	1
not	1
all	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
Being	1
even	1
God	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
for	1
both	1
food	1
and	1
raiment	1
and	1
for	1
gold	1
and	1
for	1
silver	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
riches	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Mosiah	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
behold	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
calling	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
begging	1
for	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
And	1
has	1
he	1
suffered	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
begged	1
in	1
vain	1
Nay	1
he	1
has	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
has	1
caused	1
that	1
your	1
hearts	1
should	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
has	1
caused	1
that	1
your	1
mouths	1
should	1
be	1
stopped	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
utterance	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
was	1
your	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
421	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
created	1
you	1
on	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
dependent	1
for	1
your	1
lives	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
and	1
are	1
doth	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
ask	1
that	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
faith	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
O	1
then	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
impart	1
of	1
the	1
substance	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
422	1
22	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
judge	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
putteth	1
up	1
his	1
petition	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
substance	1
that	1
he	1
perish	1
not	1
and	1
condemn	1
him	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
just	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
condemnation	1
for	1
withholding	1
your	1
substance	1
which	1
doth	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
whom	1
also	1
your	1
life	1
belongeth	1
and	1
yet	1
ye	1
put	1
up	1
no	1
petition	1
nor	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
Mosiah	1
423	1
23	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
substance	1
shall	1
perish	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
rich	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
Mosiah	1
424	1
24	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
poor	1
ye	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
and	1
yet	1
have	1
sufficient	1
that	1
ye	1
remain	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
I	1
mean	1
all	1
you	1
who	1
deny	1
the	1
beggar	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
say	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
I	1
give	1
not	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
Mosiah	1
425	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
say	1
this	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
ye	1
remain	1
guiltless	1
otherwise	1
ye	1
are	1
condemned	1
and	1
your	1
condemnation	1
is	1
just	1
for	1
ye	1
covet	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
Mosiah	1
426	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
youthat	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
retaining	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
guiltless	1
before	1
GodI	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
impart	1
of	1
your	1
substance	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
such	1
as	1
feeding	1
the	1
hungry	1
clothing	1
the	1
naked	1
visiting	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
administering	1
to	1
their	1
relief	1
both	1
spiritually	1
and	1
temporally	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
wants	1
Mosiah	1
427	1
27	1
And	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
order	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
requisite	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
run	1
faster	1
than	1
he	1
has	1
strength	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
diligent	1
that	1
thereby	1
he	1
might	1
win	1
the	1
prize	1
therefore	1
all	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
order	1
Mosiah	1
428	1
28	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
whosoever	1
among	1
you	1
borroweth	1
of	1
his	1
neighbor	1
should	1
return	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
borroweth	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
doth	1
agree	1
or	1
else	1
thou	1
shalt	1
commit	1
sin	1
and	1
perhaps	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
thy	1
neighbor	1
to	1
commit	1
sin	1
also	1
Mosiah	1
429	1
29	1
And	1
finally	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
whereby	1
ye	1
may	1
commit	1
sin	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
divers	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
even	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
number	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
430	1
30	1
But	1
this	1
much	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
watch	1
yourselves	1
and	1
your	1
thoughts	1
and	1
your	1
words	1
and	1
your	1
deeds	1
and	1
observe	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
what	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1
ye	1
must	1
perish	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
man	1
remember	1
and	1
perish	1
not	1
Mosiah	1
5	1
Chapter	1

Mosiah	1
51	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
he	1
sent	1
among	1
them	1
desiring	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
if	1
they	1
believed	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
52	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
cried	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
saying	1
Yea	1
we	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
and	1
truth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Omnipotent	1
which	1
has	1
wrought	1
a	1
mighty	1
change	1
in	1
us	1
or	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
disposition	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
continually	1
Mosiah	1
53	1
3	1
And	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
through	1
the	1
infinite	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit	1
have	1
great	1
views	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
expedient	1
we	1
could	1
prophesy	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
Mosiah	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
our	1
king	1
has	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
has	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
knowledge	1
whereby	1
we	1
do	1
rejoice	1
with	1
such	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
55	1
5	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
his	1
commandments	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
command	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
days	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
bring	1
upon	1
ourselves	1
a	1
neverending	1
torment	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
drink	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
56	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
desired	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
desired	1
and	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
covenant	1
Mosiah	1
57	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Christ	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
for	1
behold	1
this	1
day	1
he	1
hath	1
spiritually	1
begotten	1
you	1
for	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
hearts	1
are	1
changed	1
through	1
faith	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
become	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
Mosiah	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
under	1
this	1
head	1
ye	1
are	1
made	1
free	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
head	1
whereby	1
ye	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
free	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
name	1
given	1
whereby	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
take	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
all	1
you	1
that	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
covenant	1
with	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
called	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
must	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
some	1
other	1
name	1
therefore	1
he	1
findeth	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
511	1
11	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
also	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
never	1
should	1
be	1
blotted	1
out	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
transgression	1
therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
transgress	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
be	1
not	1
blotted	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
Mosiah	1
512	1
12	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
name	1
written	1
always	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
hear	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
voice	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
513	1
13	1
For	1
how	1
knoweth	1
a	1
man	1
the	1
master	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
served	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
stranger	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
Mosiah	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
again	1
doth	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
an	1
ass	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
his	1
neighbor	1
and	1
keep	1
him	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
even	1
suffer	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
feed	1
among	1
his	1
flocks	1
but	1
will	1
drive	1
him	1
away	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
Mosiah	1
515	1
15	1
Therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
steadfast	1
and	1
immovable	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
good	1
works	1
that	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Omnipotent	1
may	1
seal	1
you	1
his	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
everlasting	1
salvation	1
and	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
power	1
and	1
justice	1
and	1
mercy	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
who	1
is	1
God	1
above	1
all	1
Amen	1
Mosiah	1

Chapter	1
6	1
Mosiah	1
61	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
after	1
having	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
62	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
soul	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
little	1
children	1
but	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
covenant	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
63	1
3	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
had	1
consecrated	1
his	1
son	1
Mosiah	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
charges	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
also	1
had	1
appointed	1
priests	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
hear	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
he	1
dismissed	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
Mosiah	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
Mosiah	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
fathers	1
stead	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
making	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventysix	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
Mosiah	1
65	1
5	1
And	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
lived	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
Mosiah	1
66	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
did	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
observe	1
his	1
judgments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
did	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
did	1
cause	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
himself	1
did	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
thereby	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
become	1
burdensome	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
Mosiah	1
7	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Mosiah	1
71	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
had	1
continual	1
peace	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
from	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
therefore	1
they	1
wearied	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
teasings	1
Mosiah	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
granted	1
that	1
sixteen	1
of	1
their	1
strong	1
men	1
might	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
to	1
inquire	1
concerning	1
their	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
started	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
having	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
Ammon	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
mighty	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
their	1
leader	1
Mosiah	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
course	1
they	1
should	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
therefore	1
they	1
wandered	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
forty	1
days	1
did	1
they	1
wander	1
Mosiah	1
75	1
5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
wandered	1
forty	1
days	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
hill	1
which	1
is	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
Mosiah	1
76	1
6	1
And	1
Ammon	1
took	1
three	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
Amaleki	1
Helem	1
and	1
Hem	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mosiah	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
kings	1
guard	1
and	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
were	1
committed	1
to	1
prison	1
Mosiah	1
78	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
prison	1
two	1
days	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
their	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
were	1
permitted	1
or	1
rather	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
answer	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
79	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Limhi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Noah	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeniff	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
inherit	1
this	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
king	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
whereby	1
ye	1
were	1
so	1
bold	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
when	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
guards	1
without	1
the	1
gate	1
Mosiah	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
suffered	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
preserved	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
inquire	1
of	1
you	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
my	1
guards	1
should	1
have	1
put	1
you	1
to	1
death	1
Ye	1
are	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
Mosiah	1
712	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
rising	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
O	1
king	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
thankful	1
before	1
God	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
yet	1
alive	1
and	1
am	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
endeavor	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
boldness	1
Mosiah	1
713	1
13	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
assured	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
worn	1
these	1
bands	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
Ammon	1
and	1
am	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
have	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
inquire	1
concerning	1
our	1
brethren	1
whom	1
Zeniff	1
brought	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
714	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Limhi	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ammon	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
and	1
said	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
my	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
are	1
yet	1
alive	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
also	1
Mosiah	1
715	1
15	1
For	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
are	1
taxed	1
with	1
a	1
tax	1
which	1
is	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
our	1
brethren	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
bondage	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
slaves	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
we	1
be	1
slaves	1
to	1
the	1
Nephites	1
than	1
to	1
pay	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
716	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
king	1
Limhi	1
commanded	1
his	1
guards	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
bind	1
Ammon	1
nor	1
his	1
brethren	1
but	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
which	1
was	1
north	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
bring	1
their	1
brethren	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
and	1
rest	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
had	1
suffered	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
fatigue	1
Mosiah	1
717	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
that	1
king	1
Limhi	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
wise	1
saying	1
O	1
ye	1
my	1
people	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads	1
and	1
be	1
comforted	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
or	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
distant	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
to	1
our	1
enemies	1
notwithstanding	1
our	1
many	1
strugglings	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
vain	1
yet	1
I	1
trust	1
there	1
remaineth	1
an	1

Therefore	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads	1
and	1
rejoice	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
in	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
brought	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
and	1
fed	1
them	1
with	1
manna	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
did	1
he	1
do	1
for	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
again	1
that	1
same	1
God	1
has	1
brought	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
has	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
his	1
people	1
even	1
until	1
now	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
iniquities	1
and	1
abominations	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
us	1
into	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
Zeniff	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
he	1
being	1
overzealous	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
therefore	1
being	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
craftiness	1
of	1
king	1
Laman	1
who	1
having	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
treaty	1
with	1
king	1
Zeniff	1
and	1
having	1
yielded	1
up	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
possessions	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
Mosiah	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
purpose	1
of	1
bringing	1
this	1
people	1
into	1
subjection	1
or	1
into	1
bondage	1
And	1
behold	1
we	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
do	1
pay	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
our	1
corn	1
and	1
our	1
barley	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
our	1
grain	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
our	1
flocks	1
and	1
our	1
herds	1
and	1
even	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
or	1
possess	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
doth	1
exact	1
of	1
us	1
or	1
our	1
lives	1
Mosiah	1
723	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
And	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
our	1
affliction	1
great	1
Now	1
behold	1
how	1
great	1
reason	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
mourn	1
Mosiah	1
724	1
24	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
great	1
are	1
the	1
reasons	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
mourn	1
for	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
has	1
been	1
spilt	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
all	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
Mosiah	1
725	1
25	1
For	1
if	1
this	1
people	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
into	1
transgression	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
that	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
there	1
arose	1
contentions	1
among	1
them	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
shed	1
blood	1
among	1
themselves	1
Mosiah	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
have	1
they	1
slain	1
yea	1
a	1
chosen	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
and	1
prophesied	1
of	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
727	1
27	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
Christ	1
was	1
the	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
image	1
after	1
which	1
man	1
was	1
created	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
created	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Mosiah	1
728	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
did	1
they	1
do	1
which	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
them	1
Therefore	1
who	1
wondereth	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
smitten	1
with	1
sore	1
afflictions	1
Mosiah	1
729	1
29	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
succor	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
transgression	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
hedge	1
up	1
their	1
ways	1
that	1
they	1
prosper	1
not	1
and	1
their	1
doings	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
stumbling	1
block	1
before	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
730	1
30	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith	1
If	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
sow	1
filthiness	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
chaff	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
thereof	1
is	1
poison	1
Mosiah	1
731	1
31	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith	1
If	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
sow	1
filthiness	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
which	1
bringeth	1
immediate	1
destruction	1
Mosiah	1
732	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
smitten	1
and	1
afflicted	1
Mosiah	1
733	1
33	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
full	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
of	1
mind	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
he	1
will	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1

Chapter	1
8	1
Mosiah	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
king	1
Limhi	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
for	1
he	1
spake	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Mosiah	1
82	1
2	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
Ammon	1
should	1
stand	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
rehearse	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Zeniff	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
83	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
had	1
taught	1
them	1
and	1
explained	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Limhi	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
Mosiah	1
84	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
king	1
Limhi	1
dismissed	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
every	1
one	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
Mosiah	1
85	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
plates	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Ammon	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
read	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
86	1
6	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Ammon	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
record	1
the	1
king	1
inquired	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
interpret	1
languages	1
and	1
Ammon	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
Mosiah	1
87	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
forty	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
appeal	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
88	1
8	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
days	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
diligent	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
but	1
returned	1
to	1
this	1
land	1
having	1
traveled	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
among	1
many	1
waters	1
having	1
discovered	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
bones	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
beasts	1
and	1
was	1
also	1
covered	1
with	1
ruins	1
of	1
buildings	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
having	1
discovered	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
peopled	1
with	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
as	1
numerous	1
as	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
Israel	1
Mosiah	1
89	1
9	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
are	1
true	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
twentyfour	1
plates	1
which	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
engravings	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
pure	1
gold	1
Mosiah	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
breastplates	1
which	1
are	1
large	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
of	1
copper	1
and	1
are	1
perfectly	1
sound	1
Mosiah	1
811	1
11	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
swords	1
the	1
hilts	1
thereof	1
have	1
perished	1
and	1
the	1
blades	1
thereof	1
were	1
cankered	1
with	1
rust	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
interpret	1
the	1
language	1
or	1
the	1
engravings	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee	1
Canst	1
thou	1
translate	1
Mosiah	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
again	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
that	1
can	1
translate	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
desirous	1
that	1
these	1
records	1
should	1
be	1
translated	1
into	1
our	1
language	1
for	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
from	1
whence	1
these	1
records	1
came	1
or	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
desirous	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
destruction	1
Mosiah	1
813	1
13	1
Now	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
can	1
assuredly	1
tell	1
thee	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
translate	1
the	1
records	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
wherewith	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
look	1
and	1
translate	1
all	1
records	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
ancient	1
date	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
gift	1
from	1
God	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
are	1
called	1
interpreters	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
look	1
in	1
them	1
except	1
he	1
be	1
commanded	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
look	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
should	1
perish	1
And	1
whosoever	1
is	1
commanded	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
called	1
seer	1
Mosiah	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
commanded	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
this	1
high	1
gift	1
from	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
815	1
15	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
seer	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
a	1
prophet	1
Mosiah	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
seer	1
is	1
a	1
revelator	1
and	1
a	1
prophet	1
also	1
and	1
a	1
gift	1
which	1
is	1
greater	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
have	1
except	1
he	1
should	1
possess	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
yet	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
have	1
great	1
power	1
given	1
him	1
from	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
817	1
17	1
But	1
a	1
seer	1
can	1
know	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
past	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
by	1
them	1
shall	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
revealed	1
or	1
rather	1
shall	1
secret	1
things	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
and	1
hidden	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
light	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
known	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1

Thus	1
God	1
has	1
provided	1
a	1
means	1
that	1
man	1
through	1
faith	1
might	1
work	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
therefore	1
he	1

And	1
now	1
when	1
Ammon	1

made	1
an	1

of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
king	1
rejoiced	1
exceedingly	1

gave	1

Doubtless	1
a	1
great	1
mystery	1
is	1
contained	1
within	1
these	1
plates	1
and	1
these	1
interpreters	1
were	1
doubtless	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1

unfolding	1
all	1

to	1

O	1
how	1
marvelous	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
doth	1
he	1
suffer	1
with	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
how	1
blind	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
are	1
the	1
understandings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
seek	1
wisdom	1
neither	1

they	1

over	1
them	1

Yea	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
flock	1

I	1
Zeniff	1
having	1
been	1
taught	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
having	1
had	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
first	1
inheritance	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
sent	1
as	1
a	1
spy	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
spy	1
out	1
their	1
forces	1
that	1
our	1
army	1
might	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
destroy	1

when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
among	1
them	1
I	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Mosiah	1
92	1
2	1
Therefore	1
I	1
contended	1
with	1
my	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
our	1
ruler	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
treaty	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
being	1
an	1
austere	1
and	1
a	1
bloodthirsty	1
man	1
commanded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
slain	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
rescued	1
by	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
much	1
blood	1
for	1
father	1
fought	1
against	1
father	1
and	1
brother	1
against	1
brother	1
until	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
army	1
was	1
destroyed	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
we	1
returned	1
those	1
of	1
us	1
that	1
were	1
spared	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
relate	1
that	1
tale	1
to	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Mosiah	1
93	1

And	1
yet	1
I	1
being	1
overzealous	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
collected	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
started	1
again	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
smitten	1
with	1
famine	1
and	1
sore	1
afflictions	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
slow	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
94	1
4	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
we	1
pitched	1
our	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
our	1
brethren	1
were	1
slain	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
95	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
went	1
again	1
with	1
four	1
of	1
my	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
peace	1
Mosiah	1
96	1
6	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
covenanted	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
Mosiah	1
97	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
commanded	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
possess	1
it	1
Mosiah	1
98	1
8	1
And	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
buildings	1
and	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
LehiNephi	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Shilom	1
Mosiah	1
99	1
9	1
And	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
yea	1
even	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
seeds	1
with	1
seeds	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
of	1
wheat	1
and	1
of	1
barley	1
and	1
with	1
neas	1
and	1
with	1
sheum	1
and	1
with	1
seeds	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fruits	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
multiply	1
and	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
910	1
10	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
the	1
craftiness	1
of	1
king	1
Laman	1
to	1
bring	1
my	1
people	1
into	1
bondage	1
that	1
he	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
possess	1
it	1
Mosiah	1
911	1
11	1
Therefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
twelve	1
years	1
that	1
king	1
Laman	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
uneasy	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
my	1
people	1
should	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
overpower	1
them	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
912	1
12	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
lazy	1
and	1
an	1
idolatrous	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
bondage	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
glut	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
our	1
hands	1
yea	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
feast	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
our	1
fields	1
Mosiah	1
913	1
13	1
Therefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Laman	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
contend	1
with	1
my	1
people	1
therefore	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
914	1
14	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
of	1
my	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
when	1
my	1
people	1
were	1
watering	1
and	1
feeding	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
tilling	1
their	1
lands	1
a	1
numerous	1
host	1
of	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
their	1
fields	1
Mosiah	1
915	1
15	1
Yea	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
overtaken	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
did	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
protection	1
Mosiah	1
916	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
arm	1
them	1
with	1
bows	1
and	1
with	1
arrows	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
cimeters	1
and	1
with	1
clubs	1
and	1
with	1
slings	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
invent	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
battle	1
Mosiah	1
917	1
17	1
Yea	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
we	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
did	1
cry	1
mightily	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
awakened	1
to	1
a	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
918	1
18	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
hear	1
our	1
cries	1
and	1
did	1
answer	1
our	1
prayers	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
his	1
might	1
yea	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
a	1
night	1
we	1
did	1
slay	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
fortythree	1
we	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
even	1
until	1
we	1
had	1
driven	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
919	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hands	1
did	1
help	1
to	1
bury	1
their	1
dead	1
And	1
behold	1
to	1
our	1
great	1
sorrow	1
and	1
lamentation	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventynine	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
were	1
slain	1
Mosiah	1

Chapter	1
10	1
Mosiah	1
101	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
we	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
peace	1
And	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
made	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
that	1
thereby	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
weapons	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
102	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
guards	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
again	1
unawares	1
and	1
destroy	1
us	1
and	1
thus	1
I	1
did	1
guard	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
my	1
flocks	1
and	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
Mosiah	1
103	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
yea	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
Mosiah	1
104	1
4	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
raise	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fruit	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Mosiah	1
105	1
5	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
should	1
spin	1
and	1
toil	1
and	1
work	1
and	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
yea	1
and	1
cloth	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
clothe	1
our	1
nakedness	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
did	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
landthus	1
we	1
did	1
have	1
continual	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1

Mosiah	1
106	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Laman	1
died	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
his	1
people	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
war	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
107	1

But	1
I	1
had	1
sent	1
my	1
spies	1
out	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shemlon	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
discover	1
their	1
preparations	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
guard	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
108	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
with	1
their	1
numerous	1

with	1

with	1

with	1

with	1

and	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
heads	1
shaved	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
naked	1

they	1
were	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1

about	1

loins	1
Mosiah	1
109	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
caused	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
old	1
men	1
that	1
could	1
bear	1
arms	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
my	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
arms	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
ranks	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
age	1
Mosiah	1
1010	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
I	1
even	1
I	1
in	1
my	1
old	1
age	1
did	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
battle	1
Mosiah	1
1011	1
11	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
knew	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
the	1
Lord	1
nor	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
they	1
depended	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
Yet	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
strong	1
people	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
1012	1
12	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
wild	1
and	1
ferocious	1
and	1
a	1
bloodthirsty	1
people	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
is	1
thisBelieving	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
wronged	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
wronged	1
while	1
crossing	1
the	1
sea	1
Mosiah	1
1013	1
13	1
And	1
again	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
wronged	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
inheritance	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
because	1
that	1
Nephi	1
was	1
more	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lordtherefore	1
he	1
was	1
favored	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
heard	1
his	1
prayers	1
and	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
1014	1
14	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
dealings	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
because	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
1015	1
15	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
because	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
ruling	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
1016	1
16	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
for	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
robbed	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1017	1
17	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
have	1
taught	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
hate	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
murder	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
rob	1
and	1
plunder	1
them	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
an	1
eternal	1
hatred	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mosiah	1
1018	1
18	1
For	1
this	1
very	1
cause	1
has	1
king	1
Laman	1
by	1
his	1
cunning	1
and	1
lying	1
craftiness	1
and	1
his	1
fair	1
promises	1
deceived	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
my	1
people	1
up	1
into	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
destroy	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
1019	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Zeniff	1
after	1
having	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
I	1
did	1
stimulate	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
their	1
might	1
putting	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
we	1
did	1
contend	1
with	1
them	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
Mosiah	1
1020	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
drive	1
them	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
land	1
and	1
we	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
even	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
number	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1021	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
land	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
tend	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
to	1
till	1
their	1
ground	1
Mosiah	1
1022	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
being	1
old	1
did	1
confer	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
sons	1
therefore	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
my	1
people	1
Amen	1
Mosiah	1

Chapter	1
11	1
Mosiah	1
111	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zeniff	1
conferred	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
Noah	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
therefore	1
Noah	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Mosiah	1
112	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
wives	1
and	1
concubines	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
cause	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
commit	1
sin	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
abominable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
commit	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
Mosiah	1
113	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
a	1
tax	1
of	1
one	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
ziff	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
copper	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
brass	1
and	1
their	1
iron	1
and	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
fatlings	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
grain	1
Mosiah	1
114	1
4	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
did	1
he	1
take	1
to	1
support	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wives	1
and	1
his	1
concubines	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
concubines	1
thus	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Mosiah	1
115	1
5	1
For	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
consecrated	1
by	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
consecrated	1
new	1
ones	1
in	1
their	1
stead	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
Mosiah	1
116	1
6	1
Yea	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
supported	1
in	1
their	1
laziness	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
idolatry	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
whoredoms	1
by	1
the	1
taxes	1
which	1
king	1
Noah	1
had	1
put	1
upon	1
his	1
people	1
thus	1
did	1
the	1
people	1
labor	1
exceedingly	1
to	1
support	1
iniquity	1
Mosiah	1
117	1
7	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
became	1
idolatrous	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
vain	1
and	1
flattering	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
priests	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
speak	1
flattering	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
118	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Noah	1
built	1
many	1
elegant	1
and	1
spacious	1
buildings	1
and	1
he	1
ornamented	1
them	1
with	1
fine	1
work	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
of	1
ziff	1
and	1
of	1
copper	1
Mosiah	1
119	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
built	1
him	1
a	1
spacious	1
palace	1
and	1
a	1
throne	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
wood	1
and	1
was	1
ornamented	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
with	1
precious	1
things	1
Mosiah	1
1110	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
workmen	1
should	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fine	1
work	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
fine	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
copper	1
and	1
of	1
brass	1
Mosiah	1
1111	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
seats	1
which	1
were	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
priests	1
which	1
were	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
seats	1
he	1
did	1
ornament	1
with	1
pure	1
gold	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
breastwork	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
before	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
rest	1
their	1
bodies	1
and	1
their	1
arms	1
upon	1
while	1
they	1
should	1
speak	1
lying	1
and	1
vain	1
words	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
built	1
a	1
tower	1
near	1
the	1
temple	1
yea	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
tower	1
even	1
so	1
high	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
and	1
overlook	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shemlon	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
even	1
look	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
Mosiah	1
1113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
many	1
buildings	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Shilom	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
great	1
tower	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Shilom	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
resort	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Nephi	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
riches	1
which	1
he	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
taxation	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
heart	1
upon	1
his	1
riches	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
riotous	1
living	1
with	1
his	1
wives	1
and	1
his	1
concubines	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
also	1
his	1
priests	1
spend	1
their	1
time	1
with	1
harlots	1
Mosiah	1
1115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
planted	1
vineyards	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
he	1
built	1
winepresses	1
and	1
made	1
wine	1
in	1
abundance	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
winebibber	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1116	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
people	1
upon	1
small	1
numbers	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
fields	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
tending	1
their	1
flocks	1
Mosiah	1
1117	1
17	1
And	1
king	1
Noah	1
sent	1
guards	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
off	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
a	1
sufficient	1
number	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
killed	1
them	1
and	1
drove	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
flocks	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
thus	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
exercise	1
their	1
hatred	1
upon	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1118	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Noah	1
sent	1
his	1
armies	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
or	1
they	1
drove	1
them	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
therefore	1
they	1
returned	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
their	1
spoil	1
Mosiah	1
1119	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
victory	1
they	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
they	1
did	1
boast	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
saying	1
that	1
their	1
fifty	1
could	1
stand	1
against	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
boast	1
and	1
did	1
delight	1
in	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
priests	1
Mosiah	1
1120	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
prophesy	1
saying	1
Behold	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
hath	1
he	1
commanded	1
me	1
saying	1
Go	1
forth	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LordWo	1
be	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
their	1
abominations	1
and	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
anger	1
Mosiah	1
1121	1
21	1
And	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afflicted	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Mosiah	1
1122	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
am	1
a	1
jealous	1
God	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1123	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
except	1
this	1
people	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
and	1
none	1

it	1
be	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1124	1

Yea	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
slow	1
to	1
hear	1
their	1
cries	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
suffer	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
smitten	1
by	1
their	1
enemies	1
Mosiah	1
1125	1
25	1
And	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
their	1
prayers	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
afflictions	1
and	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
hath	1
he	1
commanded	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
1126	1
26	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
Mosiah	1
1127	1
27	1
Now	1
when	1
king	1
Noah	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
wroth	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
Who	1
is	1
Abinadi	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
shall	1
bring	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
such	1
great	1
affliction	1
Mosiah	1
1128	1
28	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
to	1
bring	1
Abinadi	1
hither	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
slay	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
stir	1
up	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
anger	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
to	1
raise	1
contentions	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
1129	1
29	1
Now	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
blinded	1
therefore	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
And	1
king	1
Noah	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
doings	1

Mosiah	1
121	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
after	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
that	1
Abinadi	1
came	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
disguise	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
prophesy	1
among	1
them	1

they	1

I	1

in	1
my	1

yea	1
in	1
my	1
fierce	1

I	1

in	1
their	1
iniquities	1

Yea	1
wo	1

And	1
the	1

unto	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1

shall	1
be	1
valued	1

And	1

Yea	1
and	1
I	1

And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
with	1
a	1

all	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
because	1

8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

yet	1
they	1
shall	1
leave	1

that	1

may	1
discover	1
the	1

of	1
this	1

to	1
other	1

And	1
many	1
things	1
did	1
Abinadi	1
prophesy	1
against	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
129	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
bound	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Behold	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
man	1
before	1
thee	1
who	1
has	1
prophesied	1
evil	1
concerning	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
saith	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1210	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
prophesieth	1
evil	1
concerning	1
thy	1
life	1
and	1
saith	1
that	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
garment	1
in	1
a	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire	1
Mosiah	1
1211	1
11	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
stalk	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
dry	1
stalk	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
which	1
is	1
run	1
over	1
by	1
the	1
beasts	1
and	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
Mosiah	1
1212	1
12	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
blossoms	1
of	1
a	1
thistle	1
which	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
fully	1
ripe	1
if	1
the	1
wind	1
bloweth	1
it	1
is	1
driven	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
he	1
pretendeth	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
all	1
this	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
except	1
thou	1
repent	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
1213	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
king	1
what	1
great	1
evil	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
or	1
what	1
great	1
sins	1
have	1
thy	1
people	1
committed	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
condemned	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
judged	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
Mosiah	1
1214	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
king	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
guiltless	1
and	1
thou	1
O	1
king	1
hast	1
not	1
sinned	1
therefore	1
this	1
man	1
has	1
lied	1
concerning	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
prophesied	1
in	1
vain	1
Mosiah	1
1215	1
15	1
And	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
strong	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
bondage	1
or	1
be	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
our	1
enemies	1
yea	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
prospered	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
prosper	1
Mosiah	1
1216	1
16	1
Behold	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
we	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
thou	1
mayest	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
seemeth	1
thee	1
good	1
Mosiah	1
1217	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Noah	1
caused	1
that	1
Abinadi	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
hold	1
a	1
council	1
with	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
1218	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Bring	1
him	1
hither	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
question	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1219	1
19	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cross	1
him	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
wherewith	1
to	1
accuse	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
boldly	1
and	1
withstood	1
all	1
their	1
questions	1
yea	1
to	1
their	1
astonishment	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
withstand	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
questions	1
and	1
did	1
confound	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
words	1
Mosiah	1
1220	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
1221	1
21	1
How	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1

that	1
publisheth	1
peace	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1

of	1
good	1
that	1
publisheth	1
salvation	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
Zion	1
Thy	1
God	1
reigneth	1
Mosiah	1
1222	1
22	1
Thy	1
watchmen	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
voice	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
together	1
shall	1
they	1
sing	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1

to	1
eye	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
Zion	1
Mosiah	1
1223	1
23	1
Break	1
forth	1
into	1
joy	1
sing	1
together	1
ye	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people	1
he	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jerusalem	1
Mosiah	1
1224	1
24	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
made	1
bare	1
his	1
holy	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1225	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
Abinadi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Are	1
you	1
priests	1
and	1
pretend	1
to	1
teach	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophesying	1
and	1
yet	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean	1
Mosiah	1
1226	1
26	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
perverting	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
understand	1
these	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
taught	1
them	1
therefore	1
ye	1
have	1
perverted	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
1227	1
27	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
applied	1
your	1
hearts	1
to	1
understanding	1
therefore	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
wise	1
Therefore	1
what	1
teach	1
ye	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1228	1
28	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
We	1
teach	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1
1229	1
29	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
If	1
ye	1
teach	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
keep	1
it	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
set	1
your	1
hearts	1
upon	1
riches	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
commit	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
spend	1
your	1
strength	1
with	1
harlots	1
yea	1
and	1
cause	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
commit	1
sin	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
cause	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
prophesy	1
against	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1230	1
30	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
Yea	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
tremble	1
before	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1231	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
for	1
your	1
iniquities	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
ye	1
teach	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
And	1
what	1
know	1
ye	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Doth	1
salvation	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
What	1
say	1
ye	1
Mosiah	1
1232	1
32	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
salvation	1
did	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1

But	1
now	1
Abinadi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
I	1
know	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
yea	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Sinai	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
1234	1
34	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
who	1
hath	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
1235	1
35	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
God	1
before	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
1236	1
36	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
unto	1
thee	1
any	1
graven	1
image	1
or	1
any	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
heaven	1
above	1
or	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath	1
Mosiah	1
1237	1
37	1
Now	1
Abinadi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Have	1
ye	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
And	1
have	1
ye	1
taught	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
Mosiah	1
13	1
Chapter	1
13	1
Mosiah	1
131	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
priests	1
Away	1
with	1
this	1
fellow	1
and	1
slay	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mad	1
Mosiah	1
132	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
forth	1
and	1
attempted	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
withstood	1
them	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
133	1
3	1
Touch	1
me	1
not	1
for	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
lay	1
your	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
delivered	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
deliver	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
requested	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
therefore	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
Mosiah	1
134	1
4	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
fulfil	1
the	1
commandments	1
wherewith	1
God	1
has	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
ye	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
And	1
again	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
have	1
judged	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
mad	1
Mosiah	1
135	1
5	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
durst	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
shone	1
with	1
exceeding	1
luster	1
even	1
as	1
Moses	1
did	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Sinai	1
while	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
136	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
his	1
words	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
137	1
7	1
Ye	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
slay	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
finish	1
my	1
message	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
it	1
cuts	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
hearts	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
concerning	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
138	1
8	1
Yea	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
and	1
with	1
anger	1
Mosiah	1
139	1
9	1
But	1
I	1
finish	1
my	1
message	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
matters	1
not	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
saved	1
Mosiah	1
1310	1
10	1
But	1
this	1
much	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
after	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
type	1
and	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
Mosiah	1
1311	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
read	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
studied	1
and	1
taught	1
iniquity	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1
Mosiah	1
1312	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
Thou	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
unto	1
thee	1
any	1
graven	1
image	1
or	1
any	1
likeness	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
above	1
or	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath	1
or	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
under	1
the	1
earth	1
Mosiah	1
1313	1
13	1
And	1
again	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
thyself	1
unto	1
them	1
nor	1
serve	1
them	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
am	1
a	1
jealous	1
God	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generations	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
1314	1
14	1
And	1
showing	1
mercy	1
unto	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
me	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
1315	1
15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
him	1
guiltless	1
that	1
taketh	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
vain	1
Mosiah	1
1316	1
16	1
Remember	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
holy	1
Mosiah	1
1317	1
17	1
Six	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
labor	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
thy	1
work	1
Mosiah	1
1318	1
18	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1

nor	1
thy	1
daughter	1
thy	1

nor	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates	1
Mosiah	1
1319	1
19	1
For	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
the	1
Lord	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
blessed	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
and	1
hallowed	1
it	1
Mosiah	1
1320	1
20	1
Honor	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee	1
Mosiah	1
1321	1
21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill	1
Mosiah	1
1322	1
22	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal	1
Mosiah	1
1323	1
23	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbor	1
Mosiah	1
1324	1
24	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbors	1
house	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbors	1
wife	1
nor	1
his	1
manservant	1
nor	1
his	1

nor	1
his	1

his	1
ass	1
nor	1
anything	1
that	1
is	1
thy	1
neighbors	1
Mosiah	1
1325	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
sayings	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Have	1
ye	1
taught	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
to	1
keep	1
these	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
1326	1
26	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
to	1
prophesy	1
evil	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1327	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
as	1
yet	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
expedient	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1
1328	1
28	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
salvation	1
doth	1
not	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
alone	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
atonement	1
which	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
perish	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Mosiah	1
1329	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
very	1
strict	1
law	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
quick	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
and	1
slow	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1330	1
30	1
Therefore	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
them	1
yea	1
a	1
law	1
of	1
performances	1
and	1
of	1
ordinances	1
a	1
law	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
observe	1
strictly	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
their	1
duty	1
towards	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
1331	1
31	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
types	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
Mosiah	1
1332	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
did	1
they	1
understand	1
the	1
law	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
all	1
understand	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
for	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
saved	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1333	1
33	1
For	1
behold	1
did	1
not	1
Moses	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Messiah	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
Yea	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
who	1
have	1
prophesied	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
beganhave	1
they	1
not	1
spoken	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
Mosiah	1
1334	1
34	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
said	1
that	1
God	1
himself	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
mighty	1
power	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Mosiah	1
1335	1
35	1
Yea	1
and	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
said	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
should	1
be	1
oppressed	1
and	1
afflicted	1
Mosiah	1
14	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Mosiah	1
141	1
1	1
Yea	1
even	1
doth	1
not	1
Isaiah	1
say	1
Who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
revealed	1
Mosiah	1
142	1
2	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
tender	1
plant	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
root	1
out	1
of	1
dry	1
ground	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
form	1
nor	1
comeliness	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
beauty	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
desire	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
143	1
3	1
He	1
is	1
despised	1
and	1
rejected	1
of	1
men	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sorrows	1
and	1
acquainted	1
with	1
grief	1
and	1
we	1
hid	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
our	1
faces	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
despised	1
and	1
we	1
esteemed	1
him	1
not	1
Mosiah	1
144	1
4	1
Surely	1
he	1
has	1
borne	1
our	1
griefs	1
and	1
carried	1
our	1
sorrows	1
yet	1
we	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1
stricken	1
smitten	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
afflicted	1
Mosiah	1
145	1
5	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
wounded	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions	1
he	1
was	1
bruised	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
our	1
peace	1
was	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
stripes	1
we	1
are	1
healed	1
Mosiah	1
146	1
6	1
All	1
we	1
like	1
sheep	1
have	1
gone	1
astray	1
we	1
have	1
turned	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
laid	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
us	1
all	1
Mosiah	1
147	1
7	1
He	1
was	1
oppressed	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
afflicted	1
yet	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
his	1
mouth	1
he	1
is	1
brought	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
before	1
her	1
shearers	1
is	1
dumb	1
so	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
his	1
mouth	1
Mosiah	1
148	1
8	1
He	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
prison	1
and	1
from	1
judgment	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
for	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
was	1
he	1
stricken	1
Mosiah	1
149	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
grave	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
in	1
his	1
death	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
evil	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
deceit	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
Mosiah	1
1410	1
10	1
Yet	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
bruise	1
him	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
grief	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
his	1
soul	1
an	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
seed	1
he	1
shall	1
prolong	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
Mosiah	1
1411	1
11	1
He	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
travail	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
by	1
his	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
my	1
righteous	1
servant	1
justify	1
many	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
1412	1
12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
divide	1
him	1
a	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil	1
with	1
the	1
strong	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
death	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors	1
and	1
he	1
bore	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many	1
and	1
made	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
transgressors	1
Mosiah	1
15	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Mosiah	1
151	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
Abinadi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
understand	1
that	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
shall	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
152	1
2	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
flesh	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
having	1
subjected	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
being	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
Mosiah	1
153	1
3	1
The	1
Father	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
conceived	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
thus	1
becoming	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
Son	1
Mosiah	1
154	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
one	1
God	1
yea	1
the	1
very	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
of	1
earth	1
Mosiah	1
155	1
5	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
flesh	1
becoming	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
or	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
the	1
Father	1
being	1
one	1
God	1
suffereth	1
temptation	1
and	1
yieldeth	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
temptation	1
but	1
suffereth	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
mocked	1
and	1
scourged	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
disowned	1
by	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
156	1
6	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
after	1
working	1
many	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
yea	1
even	1
as	1
Isaiah	1
said	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
before	1
the	1
shearer	1
is	1
dumb	1
so	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
his	1
mouth	1
Mosiah	1
157	1
7	1
Yea	1
even	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
crucified	1
and	1
slain	1
the	1
flesh	1
becoming	1
subject	1
even	1
unto	1
death	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
being	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
Mosiah	1
158	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
God	1
breaketh	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
having	1
gained	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
death	1
giving	1
the	1
Son	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
159	1
9	1
Having	1
ascended	1
into	1
heaven	1
having	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercy	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
compassion	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
standing	1
betwixt	1
them	1
and	1
justice	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
taken	1
upon	1
himself	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
their	1
transgressions	1
having	1
redeemed	1
them	1
and	1
satisfied	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
justice	1
Mosiah	1
1510	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
an	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
seed	1
And	1
now	1
what	1
say	1
ye	1
And	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
seed	1
Mosiah	1
1511	1
11	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
whosoever	1
has	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
yea	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
who	1
have	1
prophesied	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
LordI	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
have	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
his	1
seed	1
or	1
they	1
are	1
heirs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1512	1
12	1
For	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
whose	1
sins	1
he	1
has	1
borne	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
died	1
to	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
transgressions	1
And	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
his	1
seed	1
Mosiah	1
1513	1
13	1
Yea	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
prophets	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
prophesy	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
fallen	1
into	1
transgression	1
I	1
mean	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
his	1
seed	1
Mosiah	1
1514	1
14	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
published	1
peace	1
who	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
who	1
have	1
published	1
salvation	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Zion	1
Thy	1
God	1
reigneth	1
Mosiah	1
1515	1
15	1
And	1
O	1
how	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
their	1
feet	1
Mosiah	1
1516	1
16	1
And	1
again	1
how	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
still	1
publishing	1
peace	1
Mosiah	1
1517	1
17	1
And	1
again	1
how	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
publish	1
peace	1
yea	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
henceforth	1
and	1
forever	1
Mosiah	1
1518	1
18	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
For	1
O	1
how	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
peace	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
has	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
granted	1
salvation	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1519	1
19	1
For	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
redemption	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
this	1
all	1
mankind	1
must	1
have	1
perished	1
Mosiah	1
1520	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
reigneth	1
and	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
therefore	1
he	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
Mosiah	1
1521	1
21	1
And	1
there	1
cometh	1
a	1
resurrection	1
even	1
a	1
first	1
resurrection	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christfor	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
called	1
Mosiah	1
1522	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
their	1
words	1
or	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
Mosiah	1
1523	1
23	1
They	1
are	1
raised	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
redeemed	1
them	1
thus	1
they	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
Christ	1
who	1
has	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
1524	1
24	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
died	1
before	1
Christ	1
came	1
in	1
their	1
ignorance	1
not	1
having	1
salvation	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Lord	1
bringeth	1
about	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
these	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
or	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
being	1
redeemed	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
1525	1
25	1
And	1
little	1
children	1
also	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
Mosiah	1
1526	1
26	1
But	1
behold	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
tremble	1
before	1
God	1
for	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
tremble	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
redeemeth	1
none	1
such	1
that	1
rebel	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
die	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
perished	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
that	1
have	1
wilfully	1
rebelled	1
against	1
God	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
keep	1
them	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
Mosiah	1
1527	1
27	1
Therefore	1
ought	1
ye	1
not	1
to	1
tremble	1
For	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
to	1
none	1
such	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
none	1
such	1
yea	1
neither	1
can	1
the	1
Lord	1
redeem	1
such	1
for	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
himself	1
for	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
justice	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
its	1
claim	1
Mosiah	1
1528	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
declared	1
to	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1529	1
29	1
Yea	1
Lord	1
thy	1
watchmen	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
together	1
shall	1
they	1
sing	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
eye	1
to	1
eye	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
Zion	1
Mosiah	1
1530	1
30	1
Break	1
forth	1
into	1
joy	1
sing	1
together	1
ye	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people	1
he	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jerusalem	1
Mosiah	1
1531	1
31	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
made	1
bare	1
his	1
holy	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
16	1
Chapter	1
16	1
Mosiah	1
161	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
The	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
when	1
all	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
when	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
shall	1
see	1
eye	1
to	1
eye	1
and	1
shall	1
confess	1
before	1
God	1
that	1
his	1
judgments	1
are	1
just	1
Mosiah	1
162	1
2	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
wicked	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
howl	1
and	1
weep	1
and	1
wail	1
and	1
gnash	1
their	1
teeth	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
redeemeth	1
them	1
not	1
Mosiah	1
163	1
3	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
carnal	1
and	1
devilish	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
old	1
serpent	1
that	1
did	1
beguile	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
fall	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
becoming	1
carnal	1
sensual	1
devilish	1
knowing	1
evil	1
from	1
good	1
subjecting	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
Mosiah	1
164	1
4	1
Thus	1
all	1
mankind	1
were	1
lost	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
endlessly	1
lost	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
God	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
lost	1
and	1
fallen	1
state	1
Mosiah	1
165	1
5	1
But	1
remember	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
persists	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
carnal	1
nature	1
and	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
rebellion	1
against	1
God	1
remaineth	1
in	1
his	1
fallen	1
state	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
hath	1
all	1
power	1
over	1
him	1
Therefore	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
was	1

And	1
now	1
if	1
Christ	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
speaking	1
of	1
things	1
to	1

no	1

And	1
if	1
Christ	1
had	1
not	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
or	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1

that	1
the	1

should	1
have	1
no	1

and	1
that	1

no	1

there	1
could	1

been	1
no	1
resurrection	1
Mosiah	1
168	1

But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
resurrection	1
therefore	1
the	1
grave	1
hath	1
no	1
victory	1
and	1
the	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
169	1

He	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
yea	1
a	1
light	1
that	1
is	1

that	1
can	1
never	1
be	1

yea	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
endless	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
1610	1
10	1
Even	1
this	1
mortal	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
immortality	1
and	1
this	1
corruption	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
Mosiah	1
1611	1
11	1
If	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
endless	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
to	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
endless	1
damnation	1
being	1
delivered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
hath	1
subjected	1
them	1
which	1
is	1
damnation	1
Mosiah	1
1612	1
12	1
Having	1
gone	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
carnal	1
wills	1
and	1
desires	1
having	1
never	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
while	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
mercy	1
were	1
extended	1
towards	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
mercy	1
were	1
extended	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
they	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
commanded	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
repent	1
Mosiah	1
1613	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
ought	1
ye	1
not	1
to	1
tremble	1
and	1
repent	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
remember	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
Christ	1
ye	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
Mosiah	1
1614	1
14	1
Therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
teach	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
also	1
teach	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
Mosiah	1
1615	1
15	1
Teach	1
them	1
that	1
redemption	1
cometh	1
through	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
Amen	1
Mosiah	1
17	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Mosiah	1
171	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
sayings	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
should	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
172	1
2	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Alma	1
he	1
also	1
being	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
believed	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
concerning	1
the	1
iniquity	1
which	1
Abinadi	1
has	1
testified	1
against	1
them	1
therefore	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
plead	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
Abinadi	1
but	1
suffer	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
depart	1
in	1
peace	1
Mosiah	1
173	1
3	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
more	1
wroth	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
Alma	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
after	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
slay	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
174	1
4	1
But	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
not	1
And	1
he	1
being	1
concealed	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
did	1
write	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
spoken	1
Mosiah	1
175	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
guards	1
should	1
surround	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison	1
Mosiah	1
176	1
6	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
having	1
counseled	1
with	1
his	1
priests	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
again	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
177	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Abinadi	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
an	1
accusation	1
against	1
thee	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
178	1
8	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
God	1
himself	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
unless	1
thou	1
wilt	1
recall	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
evil	1
concerning	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
179	1
9	1
Now	1
Abinadi	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
recall	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
Mosiah	1
1710	1
10	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
suffer	1
even	1
until	1
death	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
recall	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
you	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
slay	1
me	1
ye	1
will	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
also	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Mosiah	1
1711	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
king	1
Noah	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
release	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
his	1
word	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
1712	1
12	1
But	1
the	1
priests	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him	1
saying	1
He	1
has	1
reviled	1
the	1
king	1
Therefore	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
stirred	1
up	1
in	1
anger	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
slain	1
Mosiah	1
1713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
and	1
scourged	1
his	1
skin	1
with	1
faggots	1
yea	1
even	1
unto	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
1714	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
flames	1
began	1
to	1
scorch	1
him	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
1715	1
15	1
Behold	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
me	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
cause	1
that	1
many	1
shall	1
suffer	1
the	1
pains	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
suffer	1
even	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
afflicted	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
diseases	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
1717	1
17	1
Yea	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
and	1
scattered	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
flock	1
is	1
driven	1
by	1
wild	1
and	1
ferocious	1
beasts	1
Mosiah	1
1718	1
18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hunted	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
and	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
suffer	1
as	1
I	1
suffer	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
Mosiah	1
1719	1
19	1
Thus	1
God	1
executeth	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
those	1
that	1
destroy	1
his	1
people	1
O	1
God	1
receive	1
my	1
soul	1
Mosiah	1
1720	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Abinadi	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
fell	1
having	1
suffered	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
yea	1
having	1
been	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
deny	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
having	1
sealed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
by	1
his	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
18	1
Chapter	1
18	1
Mosiah	1
181	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
privately	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
Mosiah	1
182	1
2	1
Yea	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
his	1
resurrection	1
and	1
ascension	1
into	1
heaven	1
Mosiah	1
183	1
3	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
hear	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
privately	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
many	1
did	1
believe	1
his	1
words	1
Mosiah	1
184	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
did	1
believe	1
him	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Mormon	1
having	1
received	1
its	1
name	1
from	1
the	1
king	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
having	1
been	1
infested	1
by	1
times	1
or	1
at	1
seasons	1
by	1
wild	1
beasts	1
Mosiah	1
185	1
5	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
Mormon	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
pure	1
water	1
and	1
Alma	1
resorted	1
thither	1
there	1
being	1
near	1
the	1
water	1
a	1
thicket	1
of	1
small	1
trees	1
where	1
he	1
did	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
daytime	1
from	1
the	1
searches	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
186	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
believed	1
him	1
went	1
thither	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
Mosiah	1
187	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
goodly	1
number	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Mormon	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Alma	1
Yea	1
all	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
that	1
believed	1
on	1
his	1
word	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
repentance	1
and	1
redemption	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
188	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
for	1
thus	1
were	1
they	1
called	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
desirous	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
fold	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
bear	1
one	1
anothers	1
burdens	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
light	1
Mosiah	1
189	1
9	1
Yea	1
and	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
mourn	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
mourn	1
yea	1
and	1
comfort	1
those	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
as	1
witnesses	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
even	1
until	1
death	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
redeemed	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
numbered	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
Mosiah	1
1810	1
10	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
against	1
being	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
serve	1
him	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
more	1
abundantly	1
upon	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
1811	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
clapped	1
their	1
hands	1
for	1
joy	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
our	1
hearts	1
Mosiah	1
1812	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
took	1
Helam	1
he	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
cried	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
pour	1
out	1
thy	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
thy	1
servant	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
this	1
work	1
with	1
holiness	1
of	1
heart	1
Mosiah	1
1813	1
13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
Helam	1
I	1
baptize	1
thee	1
having	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
until	1
you	1
are	1
dead	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
mortal	1
body	1
and	1
may	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
may	1
he	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
Christ	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Mosiah	1
1814	1
14	1
And	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
both	1
Alma	1
and	1
Helam	1
were	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
they	1
arose	1
and	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
rejoicing	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
Mosiah	1
1815	1
15	1
And	1
again	1
Alma	1
took	1
another	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
baptized	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
only	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
bury	1
himself	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
Mosiah	1
1816	1
16	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
he	1
did	1
baptize	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Mormon	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
four	1
souls	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1817	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Christ	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
was	1
baptized	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
1818	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
having	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
ordained	1
priests	1
even	1
one	1
priest	1
to	1
every	1
fifty	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
did	1
he	1
ordain	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1819	1
19	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
teach	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taught	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
Mosiah	1
1820	1
20	1
Yea	1
even	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
preach	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
had	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1821	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
contention	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
look	1
forward	1
with	1
one	1
eye	1
having	1
one	1
faith	1
and	1
one	1
baptism	1
having	1
their	1
hearts	1
knit	1
together	1
in	1
unity	1
and	1
in	1
love	1
one	1
towards	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
1822	1
22	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
preach	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
became	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1823	1
23	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
observe	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
holy	1
and	1
also	1
every	1
day	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1824	1
24	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
ordained	1
should	1
labor	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
their	1
support	1
Mosiah	1
1825	1
25	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
every	1
week	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
apart	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
Mosiah	1
1826	1
26	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
their	1
support	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
labor	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
having	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
teach	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
1827	1
27	1
And	1
again	1
Alma	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
should	1
impart	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
he	1
should	1
impart	1
more	1
abundantly	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
but	1
little	1
but	1
little	1
should	1
be	1
required	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
Mosiah	1
1828	1
28	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
should	1
impart	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
good	1
desires	1
towards	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
priests	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
need	1
yea	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
needy	1
naked	1
soul	1
Mosiah	1
1829	1
29	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
having	1
been	1
commanded	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
walk	1
uprightly	1
before	1
God	1
imparting	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
both	1
temporally	1
and	1
spiritually	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
needs	1
and	1
their	1
wants	1
Mosiah	1
1830	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
Mormon	1
yea	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
yea	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Mormon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Mormon	1
how	1
beautiful	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
yea	1
and	1
how	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
sing	1
to	1
his	1
praise	1
forever	1
Mosiah	1
1831	1
31	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
1832	1
32	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
having	1
discovered	1
a	1
movement	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
watch	1
them	1
Therefore	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
assembling	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
they	1
were	1
discovered	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
1833	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
that	1
Alma	1
was	1
stirring	1
up	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
rebellion	1
against	1
him	1
therefore	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1834	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
were	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
army	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
1835	1
35	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
souls	1
Mosiah	1
19	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Mosiah	1
191	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
returned	1
having	1
searched	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
192	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
were	1
small	1
having	1
been	1
reduced	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
193	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
lesser	1
part	1
began	1
to	1
breathe	1
out	1
threatenings	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
contention	1
among	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
194	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Gideon	1
and	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
therefore	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
swore	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
slay	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
195	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
overpower	1
him	1
he	1
fled	1
and	1
ran	1
and	1
got	1
upon	1
the	1
tower	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
temple	1
Mosiah	1
196	1
6	1
And	1
Gideon	1
pursued	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
get	1
upon	1
the	1
tower	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shemlon	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
within	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
197	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
king	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
saying	1
Gideon	1
spare	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
destroy	1
us	1
yea	1
they	1
will	1
destroy	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
198	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
concerned	1
about	1
his	1
people	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
nevertheless	1
Gideon	1
did	1
spare	1
his	1
life	1
Mosiah	1
199	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
did	1
go	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Mosiah	1
1910	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
overtake	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1911	1
11	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
leave	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
1912	1
12	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
them	1
but	1
had	1
rather	1
stay	1
and	1
perish	1
with	1
them	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
left	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
fled	1
Mosiah	1
1913	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
tarried	1
with	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
caused	1
that	1
their	1
fair	1
daughters	1
should	1
stand	1
forth	1
and	1
plead	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
slay	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1914	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
charmed	1
with	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
their	1
women	1
Mosiah	1
1915	1
15	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
spare	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
captives	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
under	1
the	1
conditions	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
deliver	1
up	1
king	1
Noah	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
deliver	1
up	1
their	1
property	1
even	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
should	1
pay	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
Mosiah	1
1916	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
captive	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
1917	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
Limhi	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
nevertheless	1
Limhi	1
was	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
himself	1
being	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
Mosiah	1
1918	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Gideon	1
sent	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
secretly	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
all	1
save	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
Mosiah	1
1919	1
19	1
Now	1
they	1
had	1
sworn	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
tarried	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
seek	1
revenge	1
and	1
also	1
perish	1
with	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1920	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
suffer	1
even	1
unto	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
Mosiah	1
1921	1
21	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
priests	1
also	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1922	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gideon	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gideon	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
paying	1
a	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
of	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
Mosiah	1
1923	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
told	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gideon	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
had	1
fled	1
from	1
them	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
1924	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
ended	1
the	1
ceremony	1
that	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
rejoicing	1
because	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
Gideon	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
1925	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
made	1
an	1
oath	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
not	1
slay	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
1926	1
26	1
And	1
also	1
Limhi	1
being	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
having	1
the	1
kingdom	1
conferred	1
upon	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
made	1
oath	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
pay	1
tribute	1
unto	1
him	1
even	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
Mosiah	1
1927	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Limhi	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
peace	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
1928	1
28	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
set	1
guards	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
keep	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
support	1
his	1
guards	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tribute	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Mosiah	1
1929	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
king	1
Limhi	1
did	1
have	1
continual	1
peace	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
molest	1
them	1
nor	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1

1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
Shemlon	1
where	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
sing	1
and	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
themselves	1
merry	1
Mosiah	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
day	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
sing	1
and	1
to	1
dance	1
Mosiah	1
203	1

And	1
now	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
being	1
ashamed	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephi	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
fearing	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
slay	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Mosiah	1
204	1

And	1
having	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
having	1
discovered	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
laid	1
and	1
watched	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
205	1
5	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
dance	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
secret	1
places	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
206	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
found	1
that	1
their	1
daughters	1
had	1
been	1
missing	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
for	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
207	1
7	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sent	1
their	1
armies	1
forth	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
himself	1
went	1
before	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
208	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
Limhi	1
had	1
discovered	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
even	1
all	1
their	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
did	1
he	1
discover	1
therefore	1
he	1
gathered	1
his	1
people	1
together	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
Mosiah	1
209	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
waiting	1
places	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2010	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
for	1
they	1
fought	1
like	1
lions	1
for	1
their	1
prey	1
Mosiah	1
2011	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
began	1
to	1
drive	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
before	1
them	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
But	1
they	1
fought	1
for	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
children	1
therefore	1
they	1
exerted	1
themselves	1
and	1
like	1
dragons	1
did	1
they	1
fight	1
Mosiah	1
2012	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
having	1
been	1
wounded	1
and	1
left	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
so	1
speedy	1
was	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2013	1
13	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
his	1
wounds	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
before	1
Limhi	1
and	1
said	1
Behold	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
he	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
wound	1
has	1
fallen	1
among	1
their	1
dead	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
behold	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
slay	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
2014	1
14	1
But	1
Limhi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
slay	1
him	1
but	1
bring	1
him	1
hither	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
him	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
And	1
Limhi	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
cause	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
Behold	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
not	1
broken	1
the	1
oath	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
why	1
should	1
ye	1
break	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2015	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
oath	1
because	1
thy	1
people	1
did	1
carry	1
away	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
therefore	1
in	1
my	1
anger	1
I	1
did	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
thy	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2016	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
Limhi	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
therefore	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
whosoever	1
has	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
shall	1
perish	1
Therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
search	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2017	1
17	1
Now	1
when	1
Gideon	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
kings	1
captain	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
forbear	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
search	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
lay	1
not	1
this	1
thing	1
to	1
their	1
charge	1
Mosiah	1
2018	1
18	1
For	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
whom	1
this	1
people	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
And	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
the	1
ones	1
who	1
have	1
stolen	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
2019	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
tell	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
pacified	1
towards	1
us	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
already	1
preparing	1
to	1
come	1
against	1
us	1
and	1
behold	1
also	1
there	1
are	1
but	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
Mosiah	1
2020	1
20	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
come	1
with	1
their	1
numerous	1
hosts	1
and	1
except	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
pacify	1
them	1
towards	1
us	1
we	1
must	1
perish	1
Mosiah	1
2021	1
21	1
For	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
he	1
prophesied	1
against	1
usand	1
all	1
this	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
turn	1
from	1
our	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
2022	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
pacify	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
we	1
fulfil	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
bondage	1
than	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
lose	1
our	1
lives	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
blood	1
Mosiah	1
2023	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
Limhi	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
had	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
attributed	1
the	1
carrying	1
away	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2024	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
pacified	1
towards	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
people	1
without	1
arms	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
not	1
slay	1
thy	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2025	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
without	1
arms	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
meet	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
bow	1
himself	1
down	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
plead	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
2026	1

And	1
when	1
the	1

saw	1
the	1

of	1
Limhi	1
that	1

were	1
without	1

they	1
had	1
compassion	1

1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1

that	1
Limhi	1
and	1
his	1

returned	1
to	1
the	1

began	1

peace	1
Mosiah	1
212	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
in	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
Mosiah	1
213	1
3	1
Now	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
slay	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
their	1
king	1
had	1
made	1
unto	1
Limhi	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
smite	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
cheeks	1
and	1
exercise	1
authority	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
put	1
heavy	1
burdens	1
upon	1
their	1
backs	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
a	1
dumb	1
ass	1
Mosiah	1
214	1
4	1
Yea	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Mosiah	1
215	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
great	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
surrounded	1
them	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
Mosiah	1
216	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
afflictions	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
desirous	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
battle	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
afflict	1
the	1
king	1
sorely	1
with	1
their	1
complaints	1
therefore	1
he	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
Mosiah	1
217	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
their	1
armor	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
218	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
back	1
and	1
slew	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
219	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
mourning	1
and	1
lamentation	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
the	1
widow	1
mourning	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
mourning	1
for	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
brothers	1
for	1
their	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
2110	1
10	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
widows	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
mightily	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2111	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
their	1
continual	1
cries	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
again	1
suffering	1
much	1
loss	1
Mosiah	1
2112	1
12	1
Yea	1
they	1
went	1
again	1
even	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
and	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
manner	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mosiah	1
2113	1
13	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
subjecting	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage	1
submitting	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
burdened	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Mosiah	1
2114	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
humility	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
mightily	1
to	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
did	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
afflictions	1
Mosiah	1
2115	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
slow	1
to	1
hear	1
their	1
cry	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
hear	1
their	1
cries	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
ease	1
their	1
burdens	1
yet	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
fit	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
2116	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
by	1
degrees	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
raise	1
grain	1
more	1
abundantly	1
and	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
suffer	1
with	1
hunger	1
Mosiah	1
2117	1
17	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
women	1
more	1
than	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
men	1
therefore	1
king	1
Limhi	1
commanded	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
impart	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
widows	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
Mosiah	1
2118	1
18	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
kept	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
secured	1
their	1
grain	1
and	1
their	1
flocks	1
Mosiah	1
2119	1
19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
trust	1
his	1
person	1
without	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
unless	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
guards	1
with	1
him	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
2120	1
20	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
watch	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
that	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
those	1
priests	1
that	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
who	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
destruction	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2121	1
21	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
punish	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
their	1
grain	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
therefore	1
they	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2122	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
disturbance	1
between	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2123	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
having	1
been	1
without	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
his	1
guard	1
discovered	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
supposing	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
priests	1
of	1
Noah	1
therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
And	1
had	1
they	1
been	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Noah	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
2124	1
24	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
2125	1
25	1
Now	1
king	1
Limhi	1
had	1
sent	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Ammon	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
2126	1
26	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
find	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
peopled	1
yea	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
dry	1
bones	1
yea	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
peopled	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
they	1
having	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
having	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Ammon	1
Mosiah	1
2127	1
27	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
a	1
record	1
with	1
them	1
even	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
whose	1
bones	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
engraven	1
on	1
plates	1
of	1
ore	1
Mosiah	1
2128	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
Limhi	1
was	1
again	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
in	1
learning	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Ammon	1
that	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
a	1
gift	1
from	1
God	1
whereby	1
he	1
could	1
interpret	1
such	1
engravings	1
yea	1
and	1
Ammon	1
also	1
did	1
rejoice	1
Mosiah	1
2129	1
29	1
Yet	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
because	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
Mosiah	1
2130	1
30	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
king	1
Noah	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
commit	1
so	1
many	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
against	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
did	1
mourn	1
for	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Abinadi	1
Mosiah	1
2131	1
31	1
Yea	1
they	1
did	1
mourn	1
for	1
their	1
departure	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
they	1
had	1
fled	1
Now	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
gladly	1
joined	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
themselves	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
2132	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
since	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Ammon	1
king	1
Limhi	1
had	1
also	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
2133	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Limhi	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
had	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
And	1
Ammon	1
declined	1
doing	1
this	1
thing	1
considering	1
himself	1
an	1
unworthy	1
servant	1
Mosiah	1
2134	1
34	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
form	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
church	1
waiting	1
upon	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
become	1
even	1
as	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
2135	1
35	1
They	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
and	1
a	1
testimony	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
serve	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
hearts	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
prolong	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
baptism	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
hereafter	1
Mosiah	1
2136	1
36	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
king	1
Limhi	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
was	1
to	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
from	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
22	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Mosiah	1
221	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
and	1
king	1
Limhi	1
began	1
to	1
consult	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
and	1
even	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
Mosiah	1
222	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
being	1
so	1
numerous	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
them	1
thinking	1
to	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Mosiah	1
223	1
3	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Gideon	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Now	1
O	1
king	1
thou	1
hast	1
hitherto	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1

many	1
times	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
been	1

with	1
our	1

the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
224	1

And	1
now	1
O	1
king	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
found	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
unprofitable	1
servant	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
hitherto	1
listened	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
thee	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
listen	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servant	1
and	1
deliver	1
this	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
225	1
5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
granted	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
speak	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
226	1

Behold	1
the	1
back	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
back	1
wall	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
The	1
Lamanites	1
or	1
the	1
guards	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
by	1
night	1
are	1
drunken	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
send	1
a	1
proclamation	1
among	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
gather	1
together	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
drive	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
night	1
Mosiah	1
227	1
7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
command	1
and	1
pay	1
the	1
last	1
tribute	1
of	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
drunken	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
secret	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
their	1
camp	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
drunken	1
and	1
asleep	1
Mosiah	1
228	1

Thus	1
we	1
will	1
depart	1
with	1
our	1
women	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
our	1
flocks	1
and	1
our	1
herds	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
travel	1
around	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
Mosiah	1
229	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Gideon	1
Mosiah	1
2210	1
10	1
And	1
king	1
Limhi	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
gather	1
their	1
flocks	1
together	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
tribute	1
of	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
sent	1
more	1
wine	1
as	1
a	1
present	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
drink	1
freely	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
king	1
Limhi	1
did	1
send	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2211	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Limhi	1
did	1
depart	1
by	1
night	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
bent	1
their	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
2212	1
12	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
all	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
carry	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
provisions	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey	1
Mosiah	1
2213	1
13	1
And	1
after	1
being	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
they	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
joined	1
Mosiahs	1
people	1
and	1
became	1
his	1
subjects	1
Mosiah	1
2214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
received	1
them	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
received	1
their	1
records	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
2215	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
had	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
night	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
an	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
pursue	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2216	1
16	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
pursued	1
them	1
two	1
days	1
they	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
follow	1
their	1
tracks	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1

Chapter	1

Mosiah	1
231	1
1	1
Now	1
Alma	1
having	1
been	1
warned	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
having	1
made	1
it	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
their	1
grain	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
before	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
Mosiah	1
232	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
strengthen	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
could	1
not	1
overtake	1
them	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
233	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
fled	1
eight	1
days	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
234	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
and	1
pleasant	1
land	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
pure	1
water	1
Mosiah	1
235	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
buildings	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
industrious	1
and	1
did	1
labor	1
exceedingly	1
Mosiah	1
236	1
6	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
Alma	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
beloved	1
by	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
237	1
7	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
esteem	1
one	1
flesh	1
above	1
another	1
or	1
one	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
think	1
himself	1
above	1
another	1
therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
238	1
8	1
Nevertheless	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
always	1
have	1
just	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
kings	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
239	1
9	1
But	1
remember	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
snare	1
and	1
did	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
abominable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
caused	1
me	1
sore	1
repentance	1
Mosiah	1
2310	1
10	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
much	1
tribulation	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
hear	1
my	1
cries	1
and	1
did	1
answer	1
my	1
prayers	1
and	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
bringing	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
truth	1
Mosiah	1
2311	1
11	1
Nevertheless	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
glory	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
unworthy	1
to	1
glory	1
of	1
myself	1
Mosiah	1
2312	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
oppressed	1
by	1
king	1
Noah	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
into	1
iniquity	1
by	1
them	1
therefore	1
ye	1
were	1
bound	1
with	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
iniquity	1
Mosiah	1
2313	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
bonds	1
yea	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
iniquity	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
this	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
free	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
trust	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
2314	1
14	1
And	1
also	1
trust	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
teacher	1
nor	1
your	1
minister	1
except	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
walking	1
in	1
his	1
ways	1
and	1
keeping	1
his	1
commandments	1
Mosiah	1
2315	1
15	1
Thus	1
did	1
Alma	1
teach	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
love	1
his	1
neighbor	1
as	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
contention	1
among	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2316	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
Alma	1
was	1
their	1
high	1
priest	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
their	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
2317	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
none	1
received	1
authority	1
to	1
preach	1
or	1
to	1
teach	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
him	1
from	1
God	1
Therefore	1
he	1
consecrated	1
all	1
their	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
teachers	1
and	1
none	1
were	1
consecrated	1
except	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
2318	1
18	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
people	1
and	1
did	1
nourish	1
them	1
with	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
Mosiah	1
2319	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
land	1
Helam	1
Mosiah	1
2320	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
multiply	1
and	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
and	1
they	1
built	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Helam	1
Mosiah	1
2321	1
21	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
seeth	1
fit	1
to	1
chasten	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
he	1
trieth	1
their	1
patience	1
and	1
their	1
faith	1
Mosiah	1
2322	1
22	1
Neverthelesswhosoever	1
putteth	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Yea	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2323	1
23	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
and	1
none	1
could	1
deliver	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob	1
Mosiah	1
2324	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
mighty	1
power	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
great	1
were	1
their	1
rejoicings	1
Mosiah	1
2325	1
25	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Helam	1
while	1
tilling	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
behold	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2326	1
26	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Alma	1
fled	1
from	1
their	1
fields	1
and	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Helam	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
frightened	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
2327	1
27	1
But	1
Alma	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
stood	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
exhorted	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
frightened	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2328	1
28	1
Therefore	1
they	1
hushed	1
their	1
fears	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
soften	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
spare	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Mosiah	1
2329	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
soften	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
delivered	1
themselves	1
up	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
Mosiah	1
2330	1
30	1
Now	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
which	1
had	1
followed	1
after	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Limhi	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
Mosiah	1
2331	1
31	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
those	1
priests	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
Amulon	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Amulon	1
and	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
Mosiah	1
2332	1
32	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
those	1
priests	1
was	1
Amulon	1
Mosiah	1
2333	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amulon	1
did	1
plead	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
sent	1
forth	1
their	1
wives	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
plead	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
destroy	1
their	1
husbands	1
Mosiah	1
2334	1
34	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
Amulon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
destroy	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wives	1
Mosiah	1
2335	1
35	1
And	1
Amulon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
did	1
join	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
traveling	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
when	1
they	1
discovered	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
2336	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
promised	1
unto	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
show	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
them	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
their	1
liberty	1
Mosiah	1
2337	1
37	1
But	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
shown	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
would	1
not	1
keep	1
their	1
promise	1
but	1
they	1
set	1
guards	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
over	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
2338	1
38	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
and	1
also	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
wives	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2339	1
39	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
Amulon	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
24	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Mosiah	1
241	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amulon	1
did	1
gain	1
favor	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
granted	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
teachers	1
over	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shemlon	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Amulon	1
Mosiah	1
242	1
2	1
For	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
lands	1
therefore	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
appointed	1
kings	1
over	1
all	1
these	1
lands	1
Mosiah	1
243	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
was	1
Laman	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
king	1
Laman	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
a	1
numerous	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
244	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
appointed	1
teachers	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Amulon	1
in	1
every	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
taught	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
245	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
people	1
friendly	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
God	1
neither	1
did	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Amulon	1
teach	1
them	1
anything	1
concerning	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
neither	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
Mosiah	1
246	1
6	1
But	1
they	1
taught	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
their	1
record	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
write	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
Mosiah	1
247	1
7	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
increase	1
in	1
riches	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
trade	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
wax	1
great	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
cunning	1
and	1
a	1
wise	1
people	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
yea	1
a	1
very	1
cunning	1
people	1
delighting	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
plunder	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
among	1
their	1
own	1
brethren	1
Mosiah	1
248	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amulon	1
began	1
to	1
exercise	1
authority	1
over	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
persecute	1
him	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
his	1
children	1
should	1
persecute	1
their	1
children	1
Mosiah	1
249	1
9	1
For	1
Amulon	1
knew	1
Alma	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
priests	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
believed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
subject	1
to	1
king	1
Laman	1
yet	1
he	1
exercised	1
authority	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
put	1
tasks	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
put	1
taskmasters	1
over	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2410	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
their	1
afflictions	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
mightily	1
to	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2411	1
11	1
And	1
Amulon	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
stop	1
their	1
cries	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
guards	1
over	1
them	1
to	1
watch	1
them	1
that	1
whosoever	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
calling	1
upon	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
Mosiah	1
2412	1
12	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
raise	1
their	1
voices	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
but	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
Mosiah	1
2413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
afflictions	1
saying	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads	1
and	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
covenant	1
with	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
2414	1
14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ease	1
the	1
burdens	1
which	1
are	1
put	1
upon	1
your	1
shoulders	1
that	1
even	1
you	1
cannot	1
feel	1
them	1
upon	1
your	1
backs	1
even	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
stand	1
as	1
witnesses	1
for	1
me	1
hereafter	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
do	1
visit	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
afflictions	1
Mosiah	1
2415	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
burdens	1
which	1
were	1
laid	1
upon	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
made	1
light	1
yea	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
strengthen	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
bear	1
up	1
their	1
burdens	1
with	1
ease	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
submit	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
with	1
patience	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
2416	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
their	1
patience	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
again	1
saying	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
2417	1
17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
before	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
deliver	1
this	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
2418	1
18	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
gathered	1
their	1
flocks	1
together	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
their	1
grain	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
nighttime	1
were	1
they	1
gathering	1
the	1
flocks	1
together	1
Mosiah	1
2419	1
19	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
Lord	1
caused	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
taskmasters	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
profound	1
sleep	1
Mosiah	1
2420	1
20	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
traveled	1
all	1
day	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
a	1
valley	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
valley	1
Alma	1
because	1
he	1
led	1
their	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
2421	1
21	1
Yea	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Alma	1
they	1
poured	1
out	1
their	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
eased	1
their	1
burdens	1
and	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
none	1
could	1
deliver	1
them	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2422	1
22	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
yea	1
all	1
their	1
men	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
could	1
speak	1
lifted	1
their	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2423	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
Haste	1
thee	1
and	1
get	1
thou	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
awakened	1
and	1
do	1
pursue	1
thee	1
therefore	1
get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stop	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
this	1
valley	1
that	1
they	1
come	1
no	1
further	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2424	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
2425	1
25	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
twelve	1
days	1
they	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
did	1
also	1
receive	1
them	1
with	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
25	1
Chapter	1
25	1
Mosiah	1
251	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
caused	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
Mosiah	1
252	1
2	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Nephi	1
or	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
descendants	1
of	1
Nephi	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Mulek	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Mosiah	1
253	1
3	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
numerous	1
Mosiah	1
254	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
were	1
assembled	1
together	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
two	1
bodies	1
Mosiah	1
255	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
did	1
read	1
and	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
the	1
records	1
of	1
Zeniff	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
records	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zeniff	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
until	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
Mosiah	1
256	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
read	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
afflictions	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
Mosiah	1
257	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
reading	1
the	1
records	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
Mosiah	1
258	1
8	1
For	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
Mosiah	1
259	1
9	1
And	1
again	1
when	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
even	1
shed	1
many	1
tears	1
of	1
sorrow	1
Mosiah	1
2510	1
10	1
And	1
again	1
when	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
delivering	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
of	1
bondage	1
they	1
did	1
raise	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2511	1
11	1
And	1
again	1
when	1
they	1
thought	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
their	1
brethren	1
of	1
their	1
sinful	1
and	1
polluted	1
state	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
pain	1
and	1
anguish	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
Mosiah	1
2512	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Amulon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
wife	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
displeased	1
with	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
upon	1
themselves	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
Mosiah	1
2513	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
were	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
the	1
kingdom	1
had	1
been	1
conferred	1
upon	1
none	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
descendants	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mosiah	1
2514	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
and	1
reading	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
desired	1
that	1
Alma	1
should	1
also	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2515	1
15	1
And	1
Alma	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
together	1
in	1
large	1
bodies	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
one	1
body	1
to	1
another	1
preaching	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
2516	1
16	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
exhort	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2517	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
many	1
things	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
king	1
Limhi	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
baptized	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
baptized	1
also	1
Mosiah	1
2518	1
18	1
Therefore	1
Alma	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
did	1
baptize	1
them	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
baptize	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
yea	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
baptize	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
belief	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Alma	1
Mosiah	1
2519	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
granted	1
unto	1
Alma	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
establish	1
churches	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
to	1
ordain	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
over	1
every	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
2520	1
20	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
one	1
teacher	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
all	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
one	1
assembly	1
Mosiah	1
2521	1
21	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
different	1
bodies	1
being	1
called	1
churches	1
every	1
church	1
having	1
their	1
priests	1
and	1
their	1
teachers	1
and	1
every	1
priest	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Alma	1
Mosiah	1
2522	1
22	1
And	1
thus	1
notwithstanding	1
there	1
being	1
many	1
churches	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
church	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2523	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
churches	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
or	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
did	1
join	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2524	1
24	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
blessed	1
and	1
prospered	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
26	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Mosiah	1
261	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
rising	1
generation	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
being	1
little	1
children	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
262	1
2	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
believe	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Mosiah	1
263	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
hardened	1
Mosiah	1
264	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
baptized	1
neither	1
would	1
they	1
join	1
the	1
church	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
separate	1
people	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
remained	1
so	1
ever	1
after	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
carnal	1
and	1
sinful	1
state	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
265	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dissensions	1
among	1
the	1
brethren	1
they	1
became	1
more	1
numerous	1
Mosiah	1
266	1
6	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
deceive	1
many	1
with	1
their	1
flattering	1
words	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
did	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
commit	1
many	1
sins	1
therefore	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
committed	1
sin	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
should	1
be	1
admonished	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
267	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
delivered	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
by	1
the	1
teachers	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
brought	1
them	1
before	1
Alma	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
Mosiah	1
268	1
8	1
Now	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
given	1
Alma	1
the	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
269	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
concerning	1
them	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
witnesses	1
against	1
them	1
yea	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
and	1
testified	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
in	1
abundance	1
Mosiah	1
2610	1
10	1
Now	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
happened	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
therefore	1
Alma	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
2611	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Behold	1
here	1
are	1
many	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
before	1
thee	1
who	1
are	1
accused	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
divers	1
iniquities	1
And	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
therefore	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
before	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
judge	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
crimes	1
Mosiah	1
2612	1
12	1
But	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
Behold	1
I	1
judge	1
them	1
not	1
therefore	1
I	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
Mosiah	1
2613	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Alma	1
was	1
again	1
troubled	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2614	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
2615	1
15	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Alma	1
and	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
Thou	1
art	1
blessed	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
alone	1
of	1
my	1
servant	1
Abinadi	1
Mosiah	1
2616	1
16	1
And	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
alone	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2617	1
17	1
And	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
a	1
church	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2618	1
18	1
Yea	1
blessed	1
is	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
called	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
mine	1
Mosiah	1
2619	1
19	1
And	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
inquired	1
of	1
me	1
concerning	1
the	1
transgressor	1
thou	1
art	1
blessed	1
Mosiah	1
2620	1
20	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant	1
and	1
I	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
serve	1
me	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
shalt	1
gather	1
together	1
my	1
sheep	1
Mosiah	1
2621	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
hear	1
my	1
voice	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
sheep	1
and	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
receive	1
Mosiah	1
2622	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
church	1
whosoever	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
And	1
whomsoever	1
ye	1
receive	1
shall	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
freely	1
forgive	1
Mosiah	1
2623	1
23	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
that	1
taketh	1
upon	1
me	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
that	1
hath	1
created	1
them	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
that	1
granteth	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
believeth	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
a	1
place	1
at	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
Mosiah	1
2624	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
are	1
they	1
called	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
know	1
me	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
eternally	1
at	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
Mosiah	1
2625	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
second	1
trump	1
shall	1
sound	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
never	1
knew	1
me	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
2626	1
26	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
redeemed	1
Mosiah	1
2627	1
27	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
depart	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
Mosiah	1
2628	1
28	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
my	1
voice	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
receive	1
into	1
my	1
church	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Mosiah	1
2629	1
29	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Go	1
and	1
whosoever	1
transgresseth	1
against	1
me	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
judge	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
sins	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
committed	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
confess	1
his	1
sins	1
before	1
thee	1
and	1
me	1
and	1
repenteth	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
forgive	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
forgive	1
him	1
also	1
Mosiah	1
2630	1
30	1
Yea	1
and	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
my	1
people	1
repent	1
will	1
I	1
forgive	1
them	1
their	1
trespasses	1
against	1
me	1
Mosiah	1
2631	1
31	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
forgive	1
one	1
another	1
your	1
trespasses	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
he	1
that	1
forgiveth	1
not	1
his	1
neighbors	1
trespasses	1
when	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
repents	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
brought	1
himself	1
under	1
condemnation	1
Mosiah	1
2632	1
32	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Go	1
and	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
observed	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forward	1
Mosiah	1
2633	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
wrote	1
them	1
down	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
church	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2634	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
went	1
and	1
judged	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
iniquity	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
2635	1
35	1
And	1
whosoever	1
repented	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
did	1
confess	1
them	1
them	1
he	1
did	1
number	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
2636	1
36	1
And	1
those	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
confess	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
the	1
same	1
were	1
not	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
blotted	1
out	1
Mosiah	1
2637	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
did	1
regulate	1
all	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
have	1
peace	1
and	1
to	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
walking	1
circumspectly	1
before	1
God	1
receiving	1
many	1
and	1
baptizing	1
many	1
Mosiah	1
2638	1
38	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
did	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
fellow	1
laborers	1
do	1
who	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
walking	1
in	1
all	1
diligence	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
suffering	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
being	1
persecuted	1
by	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2639	1
39	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
admonish	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
admonished	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
sins	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
sins	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
being	1
commanded	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
pray	1
without	1
ceasing	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
in	1
all	1
things	1

Chapter	1
27	1
Mosiah	1
271	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
persecutions	1
which	1
were	1
inflicted	1
on	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
the	1
unbelievers	1
became	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
and	1
complain	1
to	1
their	1
leaders	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
complain	1
to	1
Alma	1
And	1
Alma	1
laid	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
their	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
And	1
Mosiah	1
consulted	1
with	1
his	1
priests	1
Mosiah	1
272	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
any	1
unbeliever	1
persecute	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
273	1
3	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strict	1
command	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
persecutions	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
equality	1
among	1
all	1
men	1
Mosiah	1
274	1
4	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
no	1
pride	1
nor	1
haughtiness	1
disturb	1
their	1
peace	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
esteem	1
his	1
neighbor	1
as	1
himself	1
laboring	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
their	1
support	1
Mosiah	1
275	1
5	1
Yea	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
should	1
labor	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
their	1
support	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
sickness	1
or	1
in	1
much	1
want	1
and	1
doing	1
these	1
things	1
they	1
did	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
276	1
6	1
And	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
peace	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
numerous	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
scatter	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
building	1
large	1
cities	1
and	1
villages	1
in	1
all	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
277	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
visit	1
them	1
and	1
prosper	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
wealthy	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
278	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
were	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
unbelievers	1
and	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Alma	1
was	1
numbered	1
among	1
them	1
he	1
being	1
called	1
Alma	1
after	1
his	1
father	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
very	1
wicked	1
and	1
an	1
idolatrous	1
man	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
many	1
words	1
and	1
did	1
speak	1
much	1
flattery	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
he	1
led	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
iniquities	1
Mosiah	1
279	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
hinderment	1
to	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
stealing	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
causing	1
much	1
dissension	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
giving	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
exercise	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2710	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
about	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
go	1
about	1
secretly	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
seeking	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
to	1
lead	1
astray	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
2711	1
11	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
about	1
rebelling	1
against	1
God	1
behold	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
descended	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder	1
which	1
caused	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
shake	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
stood	1
Mosiah	1
2712	1
12	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
astonishment	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2713	1
13	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
cried	1
again	1
saying	1
Alma	1
arise	1
and	1
stand	1
forth	1
for	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
church	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
it	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
overthrow	1
it	1
save	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2714	1
14	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
Alma	1
who	1
is	1
thy	1
father	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
prayed	1
with	1
much	1
faith	1
concerning	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
therefore	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
have	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
convince	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
might	1
be	1
answered	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
Mosiah	1
2715	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
can	1
ye	1
dispute	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
For	1
behold	1
doth	1
not	1
my	1
voice	1
shake	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
can	1
ye	1
not	1
also	1
behold	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2716	1
16	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
Go	1
and	1
remember	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
remember	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
delivered	1
them	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
Alma	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
and	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
their	1
prayers	1
may	1
be	1
answered	1
and	1
this	1
even	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
of	1
thyself	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
Mosiah	1
2717	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
Alma	1
and	1
he	1
departed	1
Mosiah	1
2718	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
Alma	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
fell	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
astonishment	1
for	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
they	1
had	1
beheld	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
as	1
thunder	1
which	1
shook	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
save	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
could	1
shake	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
tremble	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
part	1
asunder	1
Mosiah	1
2719	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
Alma	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
dumb	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
weak	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
his	1
hands	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
carried	1
helpless	1
even	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
laid	1
before	1
his	1
father	1
Mosiah	1
2720	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2721	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
a	1
multitude	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
witness	1
what	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
2722	1
22	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
should	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
fast	1
and	1
to	1
pray	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
open	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Alma	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
speak	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
his	1
limbs	1
might	1
receive	1
their	1
strengththat	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
opened	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2723	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
two	1
nights	1
the	1
limbs	1
of	1
Alma	1
received	1
their	1
strength	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
bidding	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort	1
Mosiah	1
2724	1
24	1
For	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
have	1
repented	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
Mosiah	1
2725	1
25	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Marvel	1
not	1
that	1
all	1
mankind	1
yea	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
born	1
again	1
yea	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
changed	1
from	1
their	1
carnal	1
and	1
fallen	1
state	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
righteousness	1
being	1
redeemed	1
of	1
God	1
becoming	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
Mosiah	1
2726	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
become	1
new	1
creatures	1
and	1
unless	1
they	1
do	1
this	1
they	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2727	1
27	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
unless	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
Mosiah	1
2728	1
28	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
wading	1
through	1
much	1
tribulations	1
repenting	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
mercy	1
hath	1
seen	1
fit	1
to	1
snatch	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
an	1
everlasting	1
burning	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2729	1
29	1
My	1
soul	1
hath	1
been	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
bonds	1
of	1
iniquity	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
darkest	1
abyss	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
behold	1
the	1
marvelous	1
light	1
of	1
God	1
My	1
soul	1
was	1
racked	1
with	1
eternal	1
torment	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
snatched	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
pained	1
no	1
more	1
Mosiah	1
2730	1
30	1
I	1
rejected	1
my	1
Redeemer	1
and	1
denied	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
foresee	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
remembereth	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
his	1
creating	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
himself	1
manifest	1
unto	1
all	1
Mosiah	1
2731	1
31	1
Yea	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
confess	1
before	1
him	1
Yea	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
when	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
stand	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
him	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
confess	1
who	1
live	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
an	1
everlasting	1
punishment	1
is	1
just	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
quake	1
and	1
tremble	1
and	1
shrink	1
beneath	1
the	1
glance	1
of	1
his	1
allsearching	1
eye	1
Mosiah	1
2732	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
began	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forward	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
Alma	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
angel	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
traveling	1
round	1
about	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
publishing	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
much	1
tribulation	1
being	1
greatly	1
persecuted	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unbelievers	1
being	1
smitten	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2733	1
33	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
impart	1
much	1
consolation	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
confirming	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
exhorting	1
them	1
with	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
much	1
travail	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2734	1
34	1
And	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Omner	1
and	1
Himni	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
Mosiah	1
2735	1
35	1
And	1
they	1
traveled	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
zealously	1
striving	1
to	1
repair	1
all	1
the	1
injuries	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
confessing	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
publishing	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
explaining	1
the	1
prophecies	1
and	1
the	1
scriptures	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
desired	1
to	1
hear	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2736	1
36	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
instruments	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
yea	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
Mosiah	1
2737	1
37	1
And	1
how	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
For	1
they	1
did	1
publish	1
peace	1
they	1
did	1
publish	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
declare	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
reigneth	1
Mosiah	1
28	1
Chapter	1
28	1
Mosiah	1
281	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
with	1
these	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
selected	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
preach	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
impart	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
282	1
2	1
That	1
perhaps	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
convince	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
that	1
perhaps	1
they	1
might	1
cure	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
hatred	1
towards	1
the	1
Nephites	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
also	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
become	1
friendly	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
contentions	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
283	1
3	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
salvation	1
should	1
be	1
declared	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
that	1
any	1
human	1
soul	1
should	1
perish	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
thoughts	1
that	1
any	1
soul	1
should	1
endure	1
endless	1
torment	1
did	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
quake	1
and	1
tremble	1
Mosiah	1
284	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
did	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
work	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
vilest	1
of	1
sinners	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
fit	1
in	1
his	1
infinite	1
mercy	1
to	1
spare	1
them	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
suffered	1
much	1
anguish	1
of	1
soul	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
suffering	1
much	1
and	1
fearing	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
forever	1
Mosiah	1
285	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
plead	1
with	1
their	1
father	1
many	1
days	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mosiah	1
286	1
6	1
And	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
went	1
and	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
let	1
his	1
sons	1
go	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
Mosiah	1
287	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
Mosiah	1
Let	1
them	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
many	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thy	1
sons	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mosiah	1
288	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
granted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
request	1
Mosiah	1
289	1
9	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
proceedings	1
hereafter	1
Mosiah	1
2810	1
10	1
Now	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
confer	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
who	1
would	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Mosiah	1
2811	1
11	1
Therefore	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
having	1
translated	1
and	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
gold	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
which	1
were	1
delivered	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Mosiah	1
2812	1
12	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
anxiety	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
beyond	1
measure	1
to	1
know	1
concerning	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
Mosiah	1
2813	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
translated	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
stones	1
which	1
were	1
fastened	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
rims	1
of	1
a	1
bow	1
Mosiah	1
2814	1
14	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
were	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
interpreting	1
languages	1
Mosiah	1
2815	1
15	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
discover	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
who	1
should	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
the	1
iniquities	1
and	1
abominations	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2816	1
16	1
And	1
whosoever	1
has	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
called	1
seer	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
old	1
times	1
Mosiah	1
2817	1
17	1
Now	1
after	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
finished	1
translating	1
these	1
records	1
behold	1
it	1
gave	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
destroyed	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
destroyed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
tower	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
Lord	1
confounded	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
back	1
until	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
Adam	1
Mosiah	1
2818	1
18	1
Now	1
this	1
account	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
to	1
mourn	1
exceedingly	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
gave	1
them	1
much	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
rejoice	1
Mosiah	1
2819	1
19	1
And	1
this	1
account	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
hereafter	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
all	1
people	1
should	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
account	1
Mosiah	1
2820	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
after	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
and	1
conferred	1
them	1
upon	1
Alma	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alma	1
yea	1
all	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
interpreters	1
and	1
conferred	1
them	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
keep	1
and	1
preserve	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
keep	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
handing	1
them	1
down	1
from	1
one	1
generation	1
to	1
another	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
Mosiah	1
29	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Mosiah	1
291	1
1	1
Now	1
when	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
desiring	1
to	1
know	1
their	1
will	1
concerning	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
292	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
saying	1
We	1
are	1
desirous	1
that	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
son	1
should	1
be	1
our	1
king	1
and	1
our	1
ruler	1
Mosiah	1
293	1
3	1
Now	1
Aaron	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
therefore	1
the	1
king	1
could	1
not	1
confer	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
him	1
neither	1
would	1
Aaron	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
kingdom	1
neither	1
were	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
willing	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Mosiah	1
294	1
4	1
Therefore	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
sent	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
written	1
word	1
sent	1
he	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
written	1
saying	1
Mosiah	1
295	1
5	1
Behold	1
O	1
ye	1
my	1
people	1
or	1
my	1
brethren	1
for	1
I	1
esteem	1
you	1
as	1
such	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
consider	1
the	1
cause	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
to	1
considerfor	1
ye	1
are	1
desirous	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
296	1
6	1
Now	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
kingdom	1
doth	1
rightly	1
belong	1
has	1
declined	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Mosiah	1
297	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
another	1
appointed	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
behold	1
I	1
fear	1
there	1
would	1
rise	1
contentions	1
among	1
you	1
And	1
who	1
knoweth	1
but	1
what	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
kingdom	1
doth	1
belong	1
should	1
turn	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
and	1
draw	1
away	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
after	1
him	1
which	1
would	1
cause	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
among	1
you	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
shedding	1
much	1
blood	1
and	1
perverting	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
298	1
8	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
wise	1
and	1
consider	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
son	1
neither	1
should	1
we	1
have	1
any	1
right	1
to	1
destroy	1
another	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Mosiah	1
299	1
9	1
And	1
if	1
my	1
son	1
should	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
vain	1
things	1
he	1
would	1
recall	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
claim	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
would	1
cause	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
commit	1
much	1
sin	1
Mosiah	1
2910	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
wise	1
and	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
will	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2911	1
11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
king	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
my	1
days	1
nevertheless	1
let	1
us	1
appoint	1
judges	1
to	1
judge	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
law	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
newly	1
arrange	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
appoint	1
wise	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
judges	1
that	1
will	1
judge	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2912	1
12	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
God	1
than	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
always	1
just	1
but	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
man	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
just	1
Mosiah	1
2913	1
13	1
Therefore	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
just	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
kings	1
who	1
would	1
establish	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
judge	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
commandments	1
yea	1
if	1
ye	1
could	1
have	1
men	1
for	1
your	1
kings	1
who	1
would	1
do	1
even	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
Benjamin	1
did	1
for	1
this	1
peopleI	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
this	1
could	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
expedient	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
always	1
have	1
kings	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
2914	1
14	1
And	1
even	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
labored	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
faculties	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
possessed	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
peace	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
wars	1
nor	1
contentions	1
no	1
stealing	1
nor	1
plundering	1
nor	1
murdering	1
nor	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
Mosiah	1
2915	1
15	1
And	1
whosoever	1
has	1
committed	1
iniquity	1
him	1
have	1
I	1
punished	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
crime	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
committed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
Mosiah	1
2916	1
16	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
because	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
just	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
or	1
kings	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
2917	1
17	1
For	1
behold	1
how	1
much	1
iniquity	1
doth	1
one	1
wicked	1
king	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
committed	1
yea	1
and	1
what	1
great	1
destruction	1
Mosiah	1
2918	1
18	1
Yea	1
remember	1
king	1
Noah	1
his	1
wickedness	1
and	1
his	1
abominations	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Behold	1
what	1
great	1
destruction	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
Mosiah	1
2919	1
19	1
And	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
interposition	1
of	1
their	1
allwise	1
Creator	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sincere	1
repentance	1
they	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
remain	1
in	1
bondage	1
until	1
now	1
Mosiah	1
2920	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
cried	1
mightily	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
and	1
thus	1
doth	1
the	1
Lord	1
work	1
with	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
extending	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
mercy	1
towards	1
them	1
that	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
Mosiah	1
2921	1
21	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
ye	1
cannot	1
dethrone	1
an	1
iniquitous	1
king	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
much	1
contention	1
and	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
much	1
blood	1
Mosiah	1
2922	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
iniquity	1
and	1
he	1
keepeth	1
his	1
guards	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
teareth	1
up	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
reigned	1
in	1
righteousness	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
trampleth	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2923	1
23	1
And	1
he	1
enacteth	1
laws	1
and	1
sendeth	1
them	1
forth	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
laws	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
wickedness	1
and	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
not	1
obey	1
his	1
laws	1
he	1
causeth	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
rebel	1
against	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
his	1
armies	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
war	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
he	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
an	1
unrighteous	1
king	1
doth	1
pervert	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness	1
Mosiah	1
2924	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
such	1
abominations	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
Mosiah	1
2925	1
25	1
Therefore	1
choose	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
judges	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
which	1
are	1
correct	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
given	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Mosiah	1
2926	1
26	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
common	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
desireth	1
anything	1
contrary	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
common	1
for	1
the	1
lesser	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
desire	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
therefore	1
this	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
your	1
lawto	1
do	1
your	1
business	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2927	1
27	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
time	1
comes	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
doth	1
choose	1
iniquity	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
yea	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
you	1
with	1
great	1
destruction	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
hitherto	1
visited	1
this	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2928	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
judges	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
judge	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
ye	1
can	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
judge	1
Mosiah	1
2929	1
29	1
If	1
your	1
higher	1
judges	1
do	1
not	1
judge	1
righteous	1
judgments	1
ye	1
shall	1
cause	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
lower	1
judges	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
judge	1
your	1
higher	1
judges	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Mosiah	1
2930	1
30	1
And	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
people	1
commit	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
answered	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
heads	1
Mosiah	1
2931	1
31	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
have	1
been	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
kings	1
therefore	1
their	1
iniquities	1
are	1
answered	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
their	1
kings	1
Mosiah	1
2932	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
this	1
inequality	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
especially	1
among	1
this	1
my	1
people	1
but	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
this	1
land	1
be	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
may	1
enjoy	1
his	1
rights	1
and	1
privileges	1
alike	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
sees	1
fit	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live	1
and	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
even	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
posterity	1
remains	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2933	1
33	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
did	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
write	1
unto	1
them	1
unfolding	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
trials	1
and	1
troubles	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
king	1
yea	1
all	1
the	1
travails	1
of	1
soul	1
for	1
their	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
explained	1
it	1
all	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2934	1
34	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
burden	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
might	1
bear	1
his	1
part	1
Mosiah	1
2935	1
35	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
unfolded	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
they	1
labored	1
under	1
by	1
having	1
an	1
unrighteous	1
king	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2936	1
36	1
Yea	1
all	1
his	1
iniquities	1
and	1
abominations	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
and	1
the	1
stealing	1
and	1
the	1
plundering	1
and	1
the	1
committing	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquities	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
enumeratedtelling	1
them	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
expressly	1
repugnant	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2937	1
37	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
sent	1
these	1
things	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
Mosiah	1
2938	1
38	1
Therefore	1
they	1
relinquished	1
their	1
desires	1
for	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
anxious	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
chance	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
expressed	1
a	1
willingness	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins	1
Mosiah	1
2939	1
39	1
Therefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
bodies	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
cast	1
in	1
their	1
voices	1
concerning	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
judges	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
rejoiced	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
liberty	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
Mosiah	1
2940	1
40	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
love	1
towards	1
Mosiah	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
tyrant	1
who	1
was	1
seeking	1
for	1
gain	1
yea	1
for	1
that	1
lucre	1
which	1
doth	1
corrupt	1
the	1
soul	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
exacted	1
riches	1
of	1
them	1
neither	1
had	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
established	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
bondage	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1

exceedingly	1
beyond	1
measure	1
Mosiah	1
2941	1
41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
appoint	1
judges	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2942	1
42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
chief	1
judge	1
he	1
being	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
his	1
father	1
having	1
conferred	1
the	1
office	1
upon	1

having	1
given	1

charge	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
Mosiah	1
2943	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
did	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
judge	1
righteous	1
judgments	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
Mosiah	1
2944	1
44	1
And	1
thus	1
commenced	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
called	1

and	1
Alma	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
chief	1
judge	1
Mosiah	1
2945	1
45	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
died	1
being	1
eighty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
having	1
lived	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Mosiah	1
2946	1
46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Mosiah	1
died	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
being	1
sixty	1

thus	1
ended	1
the	1

Now	1

that	1
in	1

of	1
the	1

he	1
had	1
established	1

they	1
were	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
abide	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
Alma	1
12	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Alma	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
brought	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
was	1
noted	1
for	1
his	1
much	1
strength	1
Alma	1
13	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
preaching	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
termed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
bearing	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
church	1
declaring	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
every	1
priest	1
and	1
teacher	1
ought	1
to	1
become	1
popular	1
and	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
labor	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
testified	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
all	1
mankind	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
fear	1
nor	1
tremble	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
rejoice	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
created	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
had	1
also	1
redeemed	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
all	1
men	1
should	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
Alma	1
15	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
these	1
things	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
many	1
did	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
even	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
support	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
money	1
Alma	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
to	1
wear	1
very	1
costly	1
apparel	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
church	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
preaching	1
Alma	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
preach	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
his	1
word	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
teachers	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
sharply	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
withstood	1
him	1
admonishing	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
18	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
Gideon	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
delivering	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
because	1
Gideon	1
withstood	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
Gideon	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
Now	1
Gideon	1
being	1
stricken	1
with	1
many	1
years	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
his	1
blows	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
slew	1
him	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
was	1
brought	1
before	1
Alma	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
crimes	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
Alma	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
pleaded	1
for	1
himself	1
with	1
much	1
boldness	1
Alma	1
112	1
12	1
But	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
priestcraft	1
has	1
been	1
introduced	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
And	1
behold	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
only	1
guilty	1
of	1
priestcraft	1
but	1
hast	1
endeavored	1
to	1
enforce	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
were	1
priestcraft	1
to	1
be	1
enforced	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
it	1
would	1
prove	1
their	1
entire	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
yea	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
done	1
much	1
good	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
were	1
we	1
to	1
spare	1
thee	1
his	1
blood	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
for	1
vengeance	1
Alma	1
114	1
14	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
condemned	1
to	1
die	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
us	1
by	1
Mosiah	1
our	1
last	1
king	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
this	1
people	1
therefore	1
this	1
people	1
must	1
abide	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
Alma	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Nehor	1
and	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
Manti	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
caused	1
or	1
rather	1
did	1
acknowledge	1
between	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
taught	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
suffered	1
an	1
ignominious	1
death	1
Alma	1
116	1
16	1
Nevertheless	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
spreading	1
of	1
priestcraft	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
preaching	1
false	1
doctrines	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
riches	1
and	1
honor	1
Alma	1
117	1
17	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
lie	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
known	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
liars	1
were	1
punished	1
therefore	1
they	1
pretended	1
to	1
preach	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
belief	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
any	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
belief	1
Alma	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
steal	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
such	1
were	1
punished	1
neither	1
durst	1
they	1
rob	1
nor	1
murder	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
murdered	1
was	1
punished	1
unto	1
death	1
Alma	1
119	1
19	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
began	1
to	1
persecute	1
those	1
that	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
120	1
20	1
Yea	1
they	1
did	1
persecute	1
them	1
and	1
afflict	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
humility	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
proud	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
impart	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
without	1
money	1
and	1
without	1
price	1
Alma	1
121	1
21	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strict	1
law	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
arise	1
and	1
persecute	1
those	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
persecution	1
among	1
themselves	1
Alma	1
122	1
22	1
Nevertheless	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
warmly	1
with	1
their	1
adversaries	1
even	1
unto	1
blows	1
yea	1
they	1
would	1
smite	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
their	1
fists	1
Alma	1
123	1
23	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
yea	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
much	1
trial	1
with	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
124	1
24	1
For	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
were	1
hardened	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
blotted	1
out	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
remembered	1
no	1
more	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
also	1
many	1
withdrew	1
themselves	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
Alma	1
125	1
25	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
trial	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
did	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
steadfast	1
and	1
immovable	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
bore	1
with	1
patience	1
the	1
persecution	1
which	1
was	1
heaped	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
126	1
26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
left	1
their	1
labor	1
to	1
impart	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
left	1
their	1
labors	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
imparted	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
all	1
returned	1
again	1
diligently	1
unto	1
their	1
labors	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
not	1
esteeming	1
himself	1
above	1
his	1
hearers	1
for	1
the	1
preacher	1
was	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
hearer	1
neither	1
was	1
the	1
teacher	1
any	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
learner	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
equal	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
labor	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
strength	1
Alma	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
impart	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
the	1
afflicted	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
wear	1
costly	1
apparel	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
neat	1
and	1
comely	1

28	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
establish	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
continual	1
peace	1
again	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
their	1
persecutions	1
Alma	1
129	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
having	1
abundance	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
needan	1
abundance	1
of	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
fatlings	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
also	1
abundance	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
and	1
abundance	1
of	1
silk	1
and	1
finetwined	1
linen	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
good	1
homely	1
cloth	1
Alma	1
130	1
30	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
their	1
prosperous	1
circumstances	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
away	1
any	1
who	1
were	1
naked	1
or	1
that	1
were	1
hungry	1
or	1
that	1
were	1
athirst	1
or	1
that	1
were	1
sick	1
or	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
nourished	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
their	1
hearts	1
upon	1
riches	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
liberal	1
to	1
all	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
both	1
bond	1
and	1
free	1
both	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
whether	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
having	1
no	1
respect	1
to	1
persons	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
need	1
Alma	1
131	1
31	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
prosper	1
and	1
become	1
far	1
more	1
wealthy	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
their	1
church	1
Alma	1
132	1
32	1
For	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
their	1
church	1
did	1
indulge	1
themselves	1
in	1
sorceries	1
and	1
in	1
idolatry	1
or	1
idleness	1
and	1
in	1
babblings	1
and	1
in	1
envyings	1
and	1
strife	1
wearing	1
costly	1
apparel	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
persecuting	1
lying	1
thieving	1
robbing	1
committing	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
murdering	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
force	1
upon	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
transgress	1
it	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
Alma	1
133	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
by	1
thus	1
exercising	1
the	1
law	1
upon	1
them	1
every	1
man	1
suffering	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
they	1
became	1
more	1
still	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
commit	1
any	1
wickedness	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
known	1
therefore	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
peace	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
until	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
2	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Alma	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
reign	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
contention	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
being	1
called	1
Amlici	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
cunning	1
man	1
yea	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
being	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
slew	1
Gideon	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
who	1
was	1
executed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
Alma	1
22	1
2	1
Now	1
this	1
Amlici	1
had	1
by	1
his	1
cunning	1
drawn	1
away	1
much	1
people	1
after	1
him	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
powerful	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
endeavor	1
to	1
establish	1
Amlici	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
23	1
3	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
alarming	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
drawn	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
persuasions	1
of	1
Amlici	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
law	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
24	1
4	1
Therefore	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
Amlici	1
should	1
gain	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
would	1
deprive	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
privileges	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
intent	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
together	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
or	1
against	1
Amlici	1
in	1
separate	1
bodies	1
having	1
much	1
dispute	1
and	1
wonderful	1
contentions	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
Alma	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
cast	1
in	1
their	1
voices	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
laid	1
before	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
against	1
Amlici	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
28	1
8	1
Now	1
this	1
did	1
cause	1
much	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
against	1
him	1
but	1
Amlici	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
favor	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
favor	1
Alma	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
did	1
consecrate	1
Amlici	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
Alma	1
210	1
10	1
Now	1
when	1
Amlici	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
them	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
subject	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
Alma	1
211	1
11	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Amlici	1
were	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Amlici	1
being	1
called	1
Amlicites	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
212	1
12	1
Therefore	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
intent	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
arm	1
themselves	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
cimeters	1
and	1
with	1
bows	1
and	1
with	1
arrows	1
and	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
with	1
slings	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Alma	1
213	1
13	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
coming	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
appointed	1
captains	1
and	1
higher	1
captains	1
and	1
chief	1
captains	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
numbers	1
Alma	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amlici	1
did	1
arm	1
his	1
men	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
appointed	1
rulers	1
and	1
leaders	1
over	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
215	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
Amnihu	1
which	1
was	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
which	1
ran	1
by	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
216	1
16	1
Now	1
Alma	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
therefore	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
with	1
his	1
captains	1
and	1
chief	1
captains	1
yea	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
armies	1
against	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
east	1
of	1
Sidon	1
And	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
did	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
with	1
great	1
strength	1
insomuch	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
fall	1
before	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
Alma	1
218	1
18	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
strengthen	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
that	1
they	1
slew	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
with	1
great	1
slaughter	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
Alma	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
pursue	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
much	1
slaughter	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
souls	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
six	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
sixty	1
and	1
two	1
souls	1
Alma	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
could	1
pursue	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
no	1
longer	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gideon	1
the	1
valley	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
that	1
Gideon	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nehor	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
valley	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
Alma	1
221	1
21	1
And	1
Alma	1
sent	1
spies	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
plans	1
and	1
their	1
plots	1
whereby	1
he	1
might	1
guard	1
himself	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
preserve	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
being	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
222	1
22	1
Now	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
were	1
called	1
Zeram	1
and	1
Amnor	1
and	1
Manti	1
and	1
Limher	1
these	1
were	1
they	1
who	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
their	1
men	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
Alma	1
223	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
being	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
and	1
struck	1
with	1
much	1
fear	1
saying	1
Alma	1
224	1
24	1
Behold	1
we	1
followed	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
great	1
astonishment	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Minon	1
above	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
numerous	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
have	1
joined	1
them	1
Alma	1
225	1
25	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
upon	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
that	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
fleeing	1
before	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
towards	1
our	1
city	1
and	1
except	1
we	1
make	1
haste	1
they	1
obtain	1
possession	1
of	1
our	1
city	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
be	1
slain	1
Alma	1
226	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
took	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gideon	1
towards	1
their	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
227	1
27	1
And	1
behold	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
being	1
as	1
numerous	1
almost	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
sands	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
Alma	1
228	1
28	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Nephites	1
being	1
strengthened	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
having	1
prayed	1
mightily	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
hear	1
their	1
cries	1
and	1
did	1
strengthen	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
did	1
fall	1
before	1
them	1
Alma	1
229	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
fought	1
with	1
Amlici	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
contend	1
mightily	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
Alma	1
230	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
being	1
exercised	1
with	1
much	1
faith	1
cried	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
and	1
spare	1
my	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
thy	1
hands	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
preserve	1
this	1
people	1
Alma	1
231	1
31	1
Now	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
contended	1
again	1
with	1
Amlici	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
strengthened	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
slew	1
Amlici	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
232	1
32	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
contended	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
fled	1
back	1
from	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
guards	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
233	1
33	1
But	1
Alma	1
with	1
his	1
guards	1
contended	1
with	1
the	1
guards	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
he	1
slew	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
back	1
Alma	1
234	1
34	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
cleared	1
the	1
ground	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
bank	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
throwing	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
into	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
that	1
thereby	1
his	1
people	1
might	1
have	1
room	1
to	1
cross	1
and	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
235	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
crossed	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
Alma	1
236	1
36	1
And	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
the	1
Nephites	1
towards	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
west	1
and	1
north	1
away	1
beyond	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
might	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
237	1
37	1
Yea	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
and	1
slain	1
and	1
driven	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
scattered	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Hermounts	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
infested	1
by	1
wild	1
and	1
ravenous	1
beasts	1
Alma	1
238	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
their	1
wounds	1
and	1
were	1
devoured	1
by	1
those	1
beasts	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
vultures	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
their	1
bones	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
heaped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
after	1
having	1
buried	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slainnow	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
were	1
not	1
numbered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
numberafter	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
burying	1
their	1
dead	1
they	1
all	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Alma	1
32	1
2	1
Now	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
fields	1
of	1
grain	1
were	1
destroyed	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
trodden	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
33	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
and	1
behold	1
their	1
bones	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
many	1
Alma	1
34	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
were	1
distinguished	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
marked	1
themselves	1
with	1
red	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
shorn	1
their	1
heads	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
35	1
5	1
Now	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
shorn	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
naked	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
skin	1
which	1
was	1
girded	1
about	1
their	1
loins	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
armor	1
which	1
was	1
girded	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
their	1
arrows	1
and	1
their	1
stones	1
and	1
their	1
slings	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
Alma	1
36	1
6	1
And	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
dark	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
mark	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
upon	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgression	1
and	1
their	1
rebellion	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
consisted	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Joseph	1
and	1
Sam	1
who	1
were	1
just	1
and	1
holy	1
men	1
Alma	1
37	1
7	1
And	1
their	1
brethren	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
cursed	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
them	1
yea	1
upon	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
Ishmaelitish	1
women	1
Alma	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
that	1
their	1
seed	1
might	1
be	1
distinguished	1
from	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
that	1
thereby	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
might	1
preserve	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
mix	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
incorrect	1
traditions	1
which	1
would	1
prove	1
their	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
did	1
mingle	1
his	1
seed	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
bring	1
the	1
same	1
curse	1
upon	1
his	1
seed	1
Alma	1
310	1
10	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
suffered	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
was	1
called	1
under	1
that	1
head	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mark	1
set	1
upon	1
him	1
Alma	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
believed	1
those	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
were	1
correct	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
Nephites	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
Alma	1
312	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
are	1
true	1
of	1
their	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
313	1
13	1
Now	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
for	1
they	1
also	1
had	1
a	1
mark	1
set	1
upon	1
them	1
yea	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
mark	1
upon	1
themselves	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
red	1
upon	1
their	1
foreheads	1
Alma	1
314	1
14	1
Thus	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Nephi	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
I	1
cursed	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
seed	1
may	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
henceforth	1
and	1
forever	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
315	1
15	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
mingleth	1
his	1
seed	1
with	1
thy	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
cursed	1
also	1
Alma	1
316	1
16	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
fighteth	1
against	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
Alma	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
he	1
that	1
departeth	1
from	1
thee	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee	1
and	1
whomsoever	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
seed	1
henceforth	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
Alma	1
318	1
18	1
Now	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
mark	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
open	1
rebellion	1
against	1
God	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
the	1
curse	1
should	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
319	1
19	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
upon	1
themselves	1
the	1
curse	1
and	1
even	1
so	1
doth	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
cursed	1
bring	1
upon	1
himself	1
his	1
own	1
condemnation	1
Alma	1
320	1
20	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
which	1
was	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
first	1
army	1
met	1
the	1
Amlicites	1
Alma	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
army	1
sent	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
322	1
22	1
Now	1
Alma	1
himself	1
being	1
afflicted	1
with	1
a	1
wound	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
323	1
23	1
But	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
a	1
numerous	1
army	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
slew	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
drove	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
then	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
being	1
troubled	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
325	1
25	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
yea	1
all	1
these	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
were	1
commenced	1
and	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
326	1
26	1
And	1
in	1
one	1
year	1
were	1
thousands	1
and	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
souls	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
world	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
reap	1
their	1
rewards	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
bad	1
to	1
reap	1
eternal	1
happiness	1
or	1
eternal	1
misery	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
they	1
listed	1
to	1
obey	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
spirit	1
or	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
Alma	1
327	1
27	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
receiveth	1
wages	1
of	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
listeth	1
to	1
obey	1
and	1
this	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
therefore	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
And	1
thus	1
endeth	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
4	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Alma	1
41	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
contentions	1
nor	1
wars	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
42	1
2	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
afflicted	1
yea	1
greatly	1
afflicted	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
fields	1
of	1
grain	1
which	1
were	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
and	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
their	1
afflictions	1
that	1
every	1
soul	1
had	1
cause	1
to	1
mourn	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
upon	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
awakened	1
to	1
a	1
remembrance	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
Alma	1
44	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
church	1
more	1
fully	1
yea	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
and	1
were	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Alma	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
consecrated	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
45	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
were	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
souls	1
that	1
united	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
were	1
baptized	1
And	1
thus	1
endeth	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
Alma	1
46	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
proud	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
and	1
their	1
fine	1
silks	1
and	1
their	1
finetwined	1
linen	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
many	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
by	1
their	1
industry	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
eyes	1
for	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
wear	1
very	1
costly	1
apparel	1
Alma	1
47	1
7	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
to	1
Alma	1
yea	1
and	1
to	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
Alma	1
had	1
consecrated	1
to	1
be	1
teachers	1
and	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
yea	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
sorely	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
their	1
people	1
Alma	1
48	1
8	1
For	1
they	1
saw	1
and	1
beheld	1
with	1
great	1
sorrow	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
their	1
hearts	1
upon	1
riches	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
scornful	1
one	1
towards	1
another	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
persecute	1
those	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
Alma	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
this	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
contentions	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
yea	1
there	1
were	1
envyings	1
and	1
strife	1
and	1
malice	1
and	1
persecutions	1
and	1
pride	1
even	1
to	1
exceed	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
stumblingblock	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
fail	1
in	1
its	1
progress	1
Alma	1
411	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
Alma	1
saw	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
lead	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unbelievers	1
on	1
from	1
one	1
piece	1
of	1
iniquity	1
to	1
another	1
thus	1
bringing	1
on	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
412	1
12	1
Yea	1
he	1
saw	1
great	1
inequality	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
some	1
lifting	1
themselves	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
pride	1
despising	1
others	1
turning	1
their	1
backs	1
upon	1
the	1
needy	1
and	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
hungry	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
athirst	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
sick	1
and	1
afflicted	1
Alma	1
413	1
13	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
cause	1
for	1
lamentations	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
while	1
others	1
were	1
abasing	1
themselves	1
succoring	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
their	1
succor	1
such	1
as	1
imparting	1
their	1
substance	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
feeding	1
the	1
hungry	1
and	1
suffering	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
for	1
Christs	1
sake	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
Alma	1
414	1
14	1
Looking	1
forward	1
to	1
that	1
day	1
thus	1
retaining	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
great	1
joy	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
power	1
and	1
deliverance	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
Alma	1
415	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
humble	1
followers	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
persecutions	1
which	1
were	1
heaped	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
seeing	1
all	1
their	1
inequality	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
sorrowful	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
him	1
Alma	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
he	1
selected	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
enact	1
laws	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
force	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
the	1
crimes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
417	1
17	1
Now	1
this	1
mans	1
name	1
was	1
Nephihah	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
appointed	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
to	1
judge	1
and	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
418	1
18	1
Now	1
Alma	1
did	1
not	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
being	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
he	1
retained	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
high	1
priest	1
unto	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
delivered	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
unto	1
Nephihah	1
Alma	1
419	1
19	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
might	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
or	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
pull	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
all	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
craftiness	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
contentions	1
which	1
were	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
seeing	1
no	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reclaim	1
them	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
bearing	1
down	1
in	1
pure	1
testimony	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
to	1
Nephihah	1
and	1
confined	1
himself	1
wholly	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
priesthood	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
prophecy	1
Alma	1
5	1
Chapter	1
5	1
Alma	1
51	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
began	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
52	1
2	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
record	1
saying	1
Alma	1
53	1
3	1
I	1
Alma	1
having	1
been	1
consecrated	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
Alma	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
having	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Nephi	1
yea	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Mormon	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
baptize	1
his	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Mormon	1
Alma	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
were	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Noah	1
by	1
the	1
mercy	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
55	1
5	1
And	1
behold	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
captivity	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
here	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
throughout	1
this	1
land	1
also	1
Alma	1
56	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
you	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
this	1
church	1
have	1
you	1
sufficiently	1
retained	1
in	1
remembrance	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
Yea	1
and	1
have	1
you	1
sufficiently	1
retained	1
in	1
remembrance	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
them	1
And	1
moreover	1
have	1
ye	1
sufficiently	1
retained	1
in	1
remembrance	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
delivered	1
their	1
souls	1
from	1
hell	1
Alma	1
57	1
7	1
Behold	1
he	1
changed	1
their	1
hearts	1
yea	1
he	1
awakened	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
and	1
they	1
awoke	1
unto	1
God	1
Behold	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
darkness	1
nevertheless	1
their	1
souls	1
were	1
illuminated	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
word	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
an	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
did	1
await	1
them	1
Alma	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
were	1
they	1
destroyed	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
Alma	1
59	1
9	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
ask	1
were	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
broken	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
which	1
encircled	1
them	1
about	1
were	1
they	1
loosed	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
they	1
were	1
loosed	1
and	1
their	1
souls	1
did	1
expand	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
sing	1
redeeming	1
love	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
saved	1
Alma	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
what	1
conditions	1
are	1
they	1
saved	1
Yea	1
what	1
grounds	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
salvation	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
Alma	1
511	1
11	1
Behold	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
youdid	1
not	1
my	1
father	1
Alma	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
And	1
was	1
he	1
not	1
a	1
holy	1
prophet	1
Did	1
he	1
not	1
speak	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
Alma	1
believe	1
them	1
Alma	1
512	1
12	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
faith	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
change	1
wrought	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
true	1
Alma	1
513	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
change	1
was	1
also	1
wrought	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
they	1
humbled	1
themselves	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
faithful	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
saved	1
Alma	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
have	1
ye	1
spiritually	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
Have	1
ye	1
received	1
his	1
image	1
in	1
your	1
countenances	1
Have	1
ye	1
experienced	1
this	1
mighty	1
change	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
Alma	1
515	1
15	1
Do	1
ye	1
exercise	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
created	1
you	1
Do	1
you	1
look	1
forward	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
view	1
this	1
mortal	1
body	1
raised	1
in	1
immortality	1
and	1
this	1
corruption	1
raised	1
in	1
incorruption	1

Or	1
otherwise	1
can	1
ye	1
imagine	1
yourselves	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
tribunal	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
your	1

I	1

unto	1
you	1
can	1
ye	1
look	1
up	1
to	1
God	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
pure	1
heart	1
and	1
clean	1

unto	1
you	1
can	1
you	1

I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
can	1
ye	1
think	1
of	1
being	1
saved	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
yielded	1
yourselves	1
to	1
become	1
subjects	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
521	1
21	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
ye	1
will	1
know	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
for	1
there	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
be	1
saved	1
except	1
his	1
garments	1
are	1
washed	1
white	1
yea	1
his	1
garments	1
must	1
be	1
purified	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
cleansed	1
from	1
all	1
stain	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
who	1

Alma	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
how	1
will	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
feel	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
having	1
your	1
garments	1
stained	1
with	1
blood	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
filthiness	1
Behold	1
what	1
will	1
these	1
things	1
testify	1
against	1
you	1
Alma	1
523	1
23	1
Behold	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
testify	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
murderers	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
guilty	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
Alma	1
524	1
24	1
Behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
Abraham	1
with	1
Isaac	1
and	1
with	1
Jacob	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
whose	1
garments	1
are	1
cleansed	1
and	1
are	1
spotless	1
pure	1
and	1
white	1
Alma	1
525	1
25	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
except	1
ye	1
make	1
our	1
Creator	1
a	1
liar	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
or	1
suppose	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
ye	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
that	1
such	1
can	1
have	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
526	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
experienced	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
felt	1
to	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
redeeming	1
love	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
can	1
ye	1
feel	1
so	1
now	1
Alma	1
527	1
27	1
Have	1
ye	1
walked	1
keeping	1
yourselves	1
blameless	1
before	1
God	1
Could	1
ye	1
say	1
if	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
to	1
die	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
within	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
sufficiently	1
humble	1
That	1
your	1
garments	1
have	1
been	1
cleansed	1
and	1
made	1
white	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ	1
who	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
sins	1
Alma	1
528	1
28	1
Behold	1
are	1
ye	1
stripped	1
of	1
pride	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
God	1
Behold	1
ye	1
must	1
prepare	1
quickly	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
soon	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
hath	1
not	1
eternal	1
life	1
Alma	1
529	1
29	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
there	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
stripped	1
of	1
envy	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
prepared	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
prepare	1
quickly	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
found	1
guiltless	1
Alma	1
530	1
30	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
is	1
there	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
doth	1
make	1
a	1
mock	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
or	1
that	1
heapeth	1
upon	1
him	1
persecutions	1
Alma	1
531	1
31	1
Wo	1
unto	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
prepared	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
repent	1
or	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
Alma	1
532	1
32	1
Yea	1
even	1
wo	1
unto	1
all	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
repent	1
repent	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
Alma	1
533	1
33	1
Behold	1
he	1
sendeth	1
an	1
invitation	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
mercy	1
are	1
extended	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
Repent	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you	1
Alma	1
534	1
34	1
Yea	1
he	1
saith	1
Come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
yea	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
life	1
freely	1
Alma	1
535	1
35	1
Yea	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
Alma	1
536	1
36	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
whosoever	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
not	1
good	1
fruit	1
or	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
the	1
same	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
wail	1
and	1
mourn	1
Alma	1
537	1
37	1
O	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
puffed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
ye	1
that	1
have	1
professed	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
righteousness	1
nevertheless	1
have	1
gone	1
astray	1
as	1
sheep	1
having	1
no	1
shepherd	1
notwithstanding	1
a	1
shepherd	1
hath	1
called	1
after	1
you	1
and	1
is	1
still	1
calling	1
after	1
you	1
but	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
voice	1
Alma	1
538	1
38	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
doth	1
call	1
you	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
name	1
he	1
doth	1
call	1
you	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
Alma	1
539	1
39	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
of	1
what	1
fold	1
are	1
ye	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
your	1
shepherd	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
his	1
fold	1
and	1
now	1
who	1
can	1
deny	1
this	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
whosoever	1
denieth	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
and	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
540	1
40	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
good	1
cometh	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
evil	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
541	1
41	1
Therefore	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
works	1
he	1
hearkeneth	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
follow	1
him	1
but	1
whosoever	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
works	1
the	1
same	1
becometh	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
he	1
hearkeneth	1
unto	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
doth	1
follow	1
him	1
Alma	1
542	1
42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
this	1
must	1
receive	1
his	1
wages	1
of	1
him	1
therefore	1
for	1
his	1
wages	1
he	1
receiveth	1
death	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
pertaining	1
unto	1
righteousness	1
being	1
dead	1
unto	1
all	1
good	1
works	1
Alma	1
543	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
hear	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
plainly	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
err	1
or	1
have	1
spoken	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
544	1
44	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
to	1
speak	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
yea	1
I	1
am	1
commanded	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
testify	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
545	1
45	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
myself	1
Behold	1
I	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
whereof	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
are	1
true	1
And	1
how	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
Alma	1
546	1
46	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed	1
many	1
days	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
myself	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
of	1
myself	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
Alma	1
547	1
47	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
thus	1
been	1
revealed	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
are	1
true	1
even	1
so	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
which	1
is	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
548	1
48	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
myself	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
is	1
true	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
yea	1
the	1
Son	1
the	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
yea	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
steadfastly	1
believeth	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
549	1
49	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
order	1
after	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
yea	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
yea	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
all	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
both	1
bond	1
and	1
free	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
aged	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
middle	1
aged	1
and	1
the	1
rising	1
generation	1
yea	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
repent	1
and	1
be	1
born	1
again	1
Alma	1
550	1
50	1
Yea	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Spirit	1
Repent	1
all	1
ye	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1

God	1

in	1
his	1
glory	1

Yea	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
Behold	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
King	1
of	1

shall	1
very	1
soon	1
shine	1
forth	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
551	1
51	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
me	1
yea	1
crieth	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
voice	1
saying	1
Go	1
forth	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
peopleRepent	1
for	1
except	1
ye	1

ye	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
Alma	1
552	1
52	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
Behold	1
the	1
ax	1
is	1
laid	1
at	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
therefore	1
every	1
tree	1
that	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
shall	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
yea	1
a	1
fire	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
consumed	1
even	1
an	1
unquenchable	1
fire	1
Behold	1
and	1
remember	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
Alma	1
553	1
53	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
can	1
ye	1
withstand	1
these	1
sayings	1
yea	1
can	1
ye	1
lay	1
aside	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
trample	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
yea	1
can	1
ye	1
be	1
puffed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
yea	1
will	1
ye	1
still	1
persist	1
in	1
the	1
wearing	1
of	1
costly	1
apparel	1
and	1
setting	1
your	1
hearts	1
upon	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
your	1
riches	1
Alma	1
554	1
54	1
Yea	1
will	1
ye	1
persist	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
better	1
one	1
than	1
another	1
yea	1
will	1
ye	1
persist	1
in	1
the	1
persecution	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
who	1
humble	1
themselves	1
and	1
do	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
into	1
this	1
church	1
having	1
been	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
bring	1
forth	1
works	1
which	1
are	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
555	1
55	1
Yea	1
and	1
will	1
you	1
persist	1
in	1
turning	1
your	1
backs	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
and	1
in	1
withholding	1
your	1
substance	1
from	1
them	1
Alma	1
556	1
56	1
And	1
finally	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
will	1
persist	1
in	1
your	1
wickedness	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
except	1
they	1
speedily	1
repent	1
Alma	1
557	1
57	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
desirous	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
come	1
ye	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
separate	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
their	1
unclean	1
things	1
and	1
behold	1
their	1
names	1
shall	1
be	1
blotted	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith	1
The	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Alma	1
558	1
58	1
For	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
grant	1
an	1
inheritance	1
at	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
what	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
this	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
speak	1
against	1
it	1
it	1
matters	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Alma	1
559	1
59	1
For	1
what	1
shepherd	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
you	1
having	1
many	1
sheep	1
doth	1
not	1
watch	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
wolves	1
enter	1
not	1
and	1
devour	1
his	1
flock	1
And	1
behold	1
if	1
a	1
wolf	1
enter	1
his	1
flock	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
drive	1
him	1
out	1
Yea	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
he	1
will	1
destroy	1
him	1
Alma	1
560	1
60	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
doth	1
call	1
after	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
voice	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
his	1
fold	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
his	1
sheep	1
and	1
he	1
commandeth	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
no	1
ravenous	1
wolf	1
to	1
enter	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
561	1
61	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Alma	1
do	1
command	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
562	1
62	1
I	1
speak	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
command	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
speak	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
invitation	1
saying	1
Come	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
Alma	1
6	1
Chapter	1
6	1
Alma	1
61	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
he	1
ordained	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
by	1
laying	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
preside	1
and	1
watch	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
62	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
who	1
repented	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
were	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
were	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
63	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
also	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
GodI	1
mean	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
heartsthe	1
same	1
were	1
rejected	1
and	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
blotted	1
out	1
that	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
not	1
numbered	1
among	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
Alma	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
65	1
5	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
liberal	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
none	1
were	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
assembling	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
66	1
6	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
were	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
oft	1
and	1
join	1
in	1
fasting	1
and	1
mighty	1
prayer	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
not	1
God	1
Alma	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
made	1
these	1
regulations	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
yea	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
upon	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gideon	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
city	1
built	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gideon	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Gideon	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nehor	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
68	1
8	1
And	1
Alma	1
went	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gideon	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
his	1
fathers	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
Amen	1

1	1
Behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
permitted	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
I	1
attempt	1
to	1
address	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
language	1
yea	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
mouth	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
I	1
having	1
been	1
wholly	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
having	1
had	1
much	1
business	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
even	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
hath	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
another	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
my	1
stead	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
much	1
mercy	1
hath	1
granted	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
having	1
great	1
hopes	1
and	1
much	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
humbled	1
yourselves	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
supplicating	1
of	1
his	1
grace	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
blameless	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
awful	1
dilemma	1
that	1
our	1
brethren	1
were	1
in	1
at	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
74	1
4	1
But	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
yea	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
of	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
established	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
righteousness	1
Alma	1
75	1
5	1
And	1
I	1
trust	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
also	1
have	1
joy	1
over	1
you	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
over	1
you	1
should	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
afflictions	1
and	1
sorrow	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
brethren	1
at	1
Zarahemla	1
for	1
behold	1
my	1
joy	1
cometh	1
over	1
them	1
after	1
wading	1
through	1
much	1
affliction	1
and	1
sorrow	1
Alma	1
76	1
6	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
unbelief	1
as	1
were	1
your	1
brethren	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
yea	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
set	1
your	1
hearts	1
upon	1
riches	1
and	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
yea	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
worship	1
idols	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
worship	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
forward	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
77	1
7	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
there	1
be	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
behold	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
than	1
they	1
allfor	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
distant	1
that	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
liveth	1
and	1
cometh	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
78	1
8	1
Behold	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
among	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
dwelling	1
in	1
his	1
mortal	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
hath	1
not	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
Now	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
this	1
much	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
all	1

But	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
hath	1
said	1
this	1
much	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Cry	1
unto	1
this	1

and	1
prepare	1

way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
paths	1
which	1
are	1
straight	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
Mary	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
forefathers	1
she	1
being	1
a	1
virgin	1
a	1
precious	1
and	1
chosen	1
vessel	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
overshadowed	1
and	1
conceive	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
suffering	1
pains	1
and	1
afflictions	1
and	1
temptations	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
pains	1
and	1
the	1
sicknesses	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
712	1
12	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
death	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
loose	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
bind	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
their	1
infirmities	1
that	1
his	1
bowels	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
mercy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
know	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
how	1
to	1
succor	1
his	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
infirmities	1
Alma	1
713	1
13	1
Now	1
the	1
Spirit	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
suffereth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
blot	1
out	1
their	1
transgressions	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
deliverance	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
Alma	1
714	1
14	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
repent	1
and	1
be	1
born	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
born	1
again	1
ye	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
therefore	1
come	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
washed	1
from	1
your	1
sins	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
is	1
mighty	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
cleanse	1
from	1
all	1
unrighteousness	1
Alma	1
715	1
15	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
and	1
lay	1
aside	1
every	1
sin	1
which	1
easily	1
doth	1
beset	1
you	1
which	1
doth	1
bind	1
you	1
down	1
to	1
destruction	1
yea	1
come	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
show	1
unto	1
your	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
witness	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
this	1
day	1
by	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
baptism	1
Alma	1
716	1
16	1
And	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
this	1
and	1
keepeth	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
the	1
same	1
will	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
yea	1
he	1
will	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
which	1
testifieth	1
in	1
me	1
Alma	1
717	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
do	1
you	1
believe	1
these	1
things	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
believe	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
believe	1
them	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
strong	1
concerning	1
that	1
yea	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
joy	1
Alma	1
718	1
18	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
much	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
dilemma	1
like	1
your	1
brethren	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
my	1
desires	1
have	1
been	1
gratified	1
Alma	1
719	1
19	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
righteousness	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
which	1
leads	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
making	1
his	1
paths	1
straight	1
Alma	1
720	1
20	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
walk	1
in	1
crooked	1
paths	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
vary	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
turning	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
or	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wrong	1
therefore	1
his	1
course	1
is	1
one	1
eternal	1
round	1
Alma	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
unholy	1
temples	1
neither	1
can	1
filthiness	1
or	1
anything	1
which	1
is	1
unclean	1
be	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
filthy	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
his	1
filthiness	1
Alma	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
awaken	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
your	1
duty	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
blameless	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
received	1
Alma	1
723	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
humble	1
and	1
be	1
submissive	1
and	1
gentle	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
entreated	1
full	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
being	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
being	1
diligent	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
asking	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
ye	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
both	1
spiritual	1
and	1
temporal	1
always	1
returning	1
thanks	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
ye	1
do	1
receive	1
Alma	1
724	1
24	1
And	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
hope	1
and	1
charity	1
and	1
then	1
ye	1
will	1
always	1
abound	1
in	1
good	1
works	1
Alma	1
725	1
25	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
you	1
and	1
keep	1
your	1
garments	1
spotless	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
at	1
last	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
Abraham	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
having	1
your	1
garments	1
spotless	1
even	1
as	1
their	1
garments	1
are	1
spotless	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out	1
Alma	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
testifieth	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
doth	1
exceedingly	1
rejoice	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
diligence	1
and	1
heed	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
my	1
word	1
Alma	1
727	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
may	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
rest	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
upon	1
your	1
houses	1
and	1
lands	1
and	1
upon	1
your	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
possess	1
your	1
women	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
good	1
works	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
and	1
forever	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
Amen	1
Alma	1
8	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Alma	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
after	1
having	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Gideon	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
having	1
established	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
before	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
yea	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
at	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
rest	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
labors	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
performed	1
Alma	1
82	1
2	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
83	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
Alma	1
departed	1
from	1
thence	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
by	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
84	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
Alma	1
85	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness	1
side	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
86	1
6	1
So	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
work	1
at	1
Melek	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
and	1
traveled	1
three	1
days	1
journey	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Ammonihah	1
Alma	1
87	1
7	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
call	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
their	1
villages	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
their	1
small	1
villages	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
first	1
possessed	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
Alma	1
88	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
89	1
9	1
Now	1
Satan	1
had	1
gotten	1
great	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
therefore	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
810	1
10	1
Nevertheless	1
Alma	1
labored	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
wrestling	1
with	1
God	1
in	1
mighty	1
prayer	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
grant	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
baptize	1
them	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
811	1
11	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts	1
saying	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
Alma	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
in	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
tradition	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
church	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
such	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
Alma	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
church	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
us	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
unto	1
Nephihah	1
therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
over	1
us	1
Alma	1
813	1
13	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
withstood	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
reviled	1
him	1
and	1
spit	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
city	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Aaron	1
Alma	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
journeying	1
thither	1
being	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
sorrow	1
wading	1
through	1
much	1
tribulation	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
soul	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
while	1
Alma	1
was	1
thus	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
sorrow	1
behold	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
Alma	1
815	1
15	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Alma	1
therefore	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
head	1
and	1
rejoice	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
great	1
cause	1
to	1
rejoice	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
thou	1
receivedst	1
thy	1
first	1
message	1
from	1
him	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
delivered	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
command	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
preach	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
yea	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
Yea	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
Alma	1
817	1
17	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
do	1
study	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
destroy	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
and	1
commandments	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
818	1
18	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
message	1
from	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
returned	1
speedily	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
another	1
way	1
yea	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
Alma	1
819	1
19	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
hungered	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
Will	1
ye	1
give	1
to	1
an	1
humble	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
Alma	1
820	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Nephite	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
holy	1
prophet	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
an	1
angel	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
Therefore	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
impart	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
my	1
food	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
a	1
blessing	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
house	1
Alma	1
821	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
called	1
Amulek	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
bread	1
and	1
meat	1
and	1
set	1
before	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
822	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
ate	1
bread	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
and	1
he	1
blessed	1
Amulek	1
and	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
thanks	1
unto	1
God	1
Alma	1
823	1
23	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Amulek	1
I	1
am	1
Alma	1
and	1
am	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
824	1
24	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
prophecy	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
receive	1
me	1
but	1
they	1
cast	1
me	1
out	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
set	1
my	1
back	1
towards	1
this	1
land	1
forever	1
Alma	1
825	1
25	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
commanded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
turn	1
again	1
and	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
to	1
testify	1
against	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
iniquities	1
Alma	1
826	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
Amulek	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
fed	1
me	1
and	1
taken	1
me	1
in	1
thou	1
art	1
blessed	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungered	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
fasted	1
many	1
days	1
Alma	1
827	1
27	1
And	1
Alma	1
tarried	1
many	1
days	1
with	1
Amulek	1
before	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
828	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
wax	1
more	1
gross	1
in	1
their	1
iniquities	1
Alma	1
829	1
29	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
came	1
to	1
Alma	1
saying	1
Go	1
and	1
also	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
servant	1
Amulek	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
sayingRepent	1
ye	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
mine	1
anger	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger	1
away	1
Alma	1
830	1
30	1
And	1
Alma	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
also	1
Amulek	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
Alma	1
831	1
31	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
power	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
confined	1
in	1
dungeons	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
could	1
slay	1
them	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
exercise	1
their	1
power	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
bands	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
might	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
them	1
Alma	1
832	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
and	1
to	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
Alma	1
9	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Alma	1
91	1
1	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
Alma	1
having	1
been	1
commanded	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
Amulek	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
preach	1
again	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
me	1
saying	1
Alma	1
92	1
2	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
believe	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
although	1
he	1
should	1
preach	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
should	1
pass	1
away	1
Alma	1
93	1
3	1
Now	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
they	1
spake	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
should	1
pass	1
away	1
Alma	1
94	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
also	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
thy	1
words	1
if	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
prophesy	1
that	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
Alma	1
95	1
5	1
Now	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
God	1
could	1
do	1
such	1
marvelous	1
works	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
and	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
Alma	1
96	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
Who	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
sendeth	1
no	1
more	1
authority	1
than	1
one	1
man	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
such	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
Alma	1
97	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
forth	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
me	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
And	1
I	1
stood	1
with	1
boldness	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
yea	1
I	1
did	1
boldly	1
testify	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Alma	1
98	1
8	1
Behold	1
O	1
ye	1
wicked	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation	1
how	1
have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
yea	1
how	1
soon	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
99	1
9	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
that	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
was	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
led	1
by	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
910	1
10	1
And	1
have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
so	1
soon	1
how	1
many	1
times	1
he	1
delivered	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
preserved	1
them	1
from	1
being	1
destroyed	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
911	1
11	1
Yea	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
his	1
matchless	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
us	1
we	1
should	1
unavoidably	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
long	1
before	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
perhaps	1
been	1
consigned	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
endless	1
misery	1
and	1
woe	1
Alma	1
912	1
12	1
Behold	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
commandeth	1
you	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
allhe	1
has	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
repent	1
or	1
he	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
you	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
anger	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
Alma	1
913	1
13	1
Behold	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Lehi	1
saying	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
914	1
14	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Now	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
been	1
verified	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
915	1
15	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
than	1
for	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
remain	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
than	1
for	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
Alma	1
916	1
16	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
promises	1
which	1
are	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
their	1
state	1
of	1
ignorance	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
prolong	1
their	1
existence	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
917	1
17	1
And	1
at	1
some	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
incorrectness	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
be	1
saved	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
all	1
who	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
918	1
18	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
persist	1
in	1
your	1
wickedness	1
that	1
your	1
days	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
prolonged	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
shall	1
be	1
sent	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
repent	1
not	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
visited	1
with	1
utter	1
destruction	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
919	1
19	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
your	1
iniquities	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
people	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
he	1
would	1
rather	1
suffer	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
might	1
destroy	1

and	1
after	1
having	1

of	1

out	1
of	1
the	1

by	1
the	1

they	1

Alma	1
923	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
received	1
so	1
many	1
blessings	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
transgress	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
knowledge	1
which	1
they	1
do	1
have	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
than	1
for	1
them	1
Alma	1
924	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
transgress	1
for	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
expressly	1
promised	1
and	1
firmly	1
decreed	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
rebel	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
utterly	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
925	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
visit	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
declaring	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
saying	1
Repent	1
ye	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand	1
Alma	1
926	1
26	1
And	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
hence	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
equity	1
and	1
truth	1
full	1
of	1
patience	1
mercy	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
quick	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
answer	1
their	1
prayers	1
Alma	1
927	1
27	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
redeem	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
through	1
faith	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
928	1
28	1
Therefore	1
prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
reap	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
works	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
beenif	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
righteous	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
deliverance	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
evil	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
damnation	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
captivation	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
929	1
29	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
crying	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
930	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
beloved	1
and	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
works	1
which	1
are	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance	1
seeing	1
that	1
your	1
hearts	1
have	1
been	1
grossly	1
hardened	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
a	1
fallen	1
people	1
Alma	1
931	1
31	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
Alma	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
and	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
Alma	1
932	1
32	1
And	1
also	1
because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
a	1
fallen	1
people	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
prison	1
Alma	1
933	1
33	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
prison	1
Alma	1
934	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amulek	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
also	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Amulek	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
written	1
nevertheless	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
Alma	1
10	1
Chapter	1
10	1
Alma	1
101	1
1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Amulek	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
saying	1
Alma	1
102	1
2	1
I	1
am	1
Amulek	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Giddonah	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Aminadi	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
Aminadi	1
who	1
interpreted	1
the	1
writing	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
103	1
3	1
And	1
Aminadi	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Nephi	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Lehi	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph	1
who	1
was	1
sold	1
into	1
Egypt	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
104	1
4	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
no	1
small	1
reputation	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
know	1
me	1
yea	1
and	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
kindreds	1
and	1
friends	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
acquired	1
much	1
riches	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
industry	1
Alma	1
105	1
5	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
never	1
have	1
known	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
his	1
mysteries	1
and	1
marvelous	1
power	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
known	1
much	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
mistake	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
mysteries	1
and	1
his	1
marvelous	1
power	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Alma	1
106	1
6	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
did	1
harden	1
my	1
heart	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
called	1
many	1
times	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
therefore	1
I	1
knew	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
therefore	1
I	1
went	1
on	1
rebelling	1
against	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
seventh	1
month	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
107	1
7	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
journeying	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
very	1
near	1
kindred	1
behold	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
Amulek	1
return	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
feed	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
a	1
holy	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
fasted	1
many	1
days	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
hungered	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
house	1
and	1
feed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
house	1
Alma	1
108	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
and	1
returned	1
towards	1
my	1
house	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
thither	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
into	1
thy	1
houseand	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
speaking	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
109	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
holy	1
man	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
holy	1
man	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
1010	1
10	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
testified	1
are	1
true	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
even	1
so	1
has	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
make	1
these	1
things	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
while	1
this	1
Alma	1
hath	1
dwelt	1
at	1
my	1
house	1
Alma	1
1011	1
11	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
mine	1
house	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
women	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
kinsfolk	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
my	1
kindred	1
hath	1
he	1
blessed	1
and	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
rested	1
upon	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
Alma	1
1012	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Amulek	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
seeing	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
witness	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
accused	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
Alma	1
1013	1
13	1
Nevertheless	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
thought	1
to	1
question	1
them	1
that	1
by	1
their	1
cunning	1
devices	1
they	1
might	1
catch	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
words	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
witness	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
judges	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
slain	1
or	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
crime	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
make	1
appear	1
or	1
witness	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
1014	1
14	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
who	1
were	1
lawyers	1
who	1
were	1
hired	1
or	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
law	1
at	1
their	1
times	1
of	1
trials	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
trials	1
of	1
the	1
crimes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
before	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
1015	1
15	1
Now	1
these	1
lawyers	1
were	1
learned	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
arts	1
and	1
cunning	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
to	1
enable	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
skilful	1
in	1
their	1
profession	1
Alma	1
1016	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
Amulek	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
make	1
him	1
cross	1
his	1
words	1
or	1
contradict	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
speak	1
Alma	1
1017	1
17	1
Now	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Amulek	1
could	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
designs	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
he	1
perceived	1
their	1
thoughts	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
O	1
ye	1
wicked	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation	1
ye	1
lawyers	1
and	1
hypocrites	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
laying	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
laying	1
traps	1
and	1
snares	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
holy	1
ones	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
1018	1
18	1
Ye	1
are	1
laying	1
plans	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
your	1
heads	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
utter	1
destruction	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Alma	1
1019	1
19	1
Yea	1
well	1
did	1
Mosiah	1
say	1
who	1
was	1
our	1
last	1
king	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
having	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
confer	1
it	1
upon	1
causing	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
voicesyea	1
well	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
time	1
should	1
come	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
should	1
choose	1
iniquity	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
the	1
time	1
should	1
come	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
ripe	1
for	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
1020	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
well	1
doth	1
the	1
Lord	1
judge	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
well	1
doth	1
he	1
cry	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
angels	1
Repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
Alma	1
1021	1
21	1
Yea	1
well	1
doth	1
he	1
cry	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
angels	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
with	1
equity	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
Alma	1
1022	1
22	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
even	1
now	1
be	1
visited	1
with	1
utter	1
destruction	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
by	1
flood	1
as	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
by	1
pestilence	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
1023	1
23	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
spared	1
now	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
then	1
will	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
stay	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
you	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
by	1
pestilence	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
soon	1
at	1
hand	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
Alma	1
1024	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
more	1
angry	1
with	1
Amulek	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
saying	1
This	1
man	1
doth	1
revile	1
against	1
our	1
laws	1
which	1
are	1
just	1
and	1
our	1
wise	1
lawyers	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
selected	1
Alma	1
1025	1
25	1
But	1
Amulek	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
cried	1
the	1
mightier	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
O	1
ye	1
wicked	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation	1
why	1
hath	1
Satan	1
got	1
such	1
great	1
hold	1
upon	1
your	1
hearts	1
Why	1
will	1
ye	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
to	1
blind	1
your	1
eyes	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
spoken	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
truth	1
Alma	1
1026	1
26	1
For	1
behold	1
have	1
I	1
testified	1
against	1
your	1
law	1
Ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
your	1
law	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
your	1
law	1
to	1
your	1
condemnation	1
Alma	1
1027	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
by	1
the	1
unrighteousness	1
of	1
your	1
lawyers	1
and	1
your	1
judges	1
Alma	1
1028	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Amulek	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
people	1
cried	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
saying	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
lied	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
our	1
law	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
against	1
it	1
Alma	1
1029	1
29	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
has	1
reviled	1
against	1
our	1
lawyers	1
and	1
our	1
judges	1
Alma	1
1030	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
lawyers	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
remember	1
these	1
things	1
against	1
him	1
Alma	1
1031	1
31	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Zeezrom	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
foremost	1
to	1
accuse	1
Amulek	1
and	1
Alma	1
he	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
expert	1
among	1
them	1
having	1
much	1
business	1
to	1
do	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
1032	1
32	1
Now	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
these	1
lawyers	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
and	1
they	1
got	1
gain	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
employ	1
Alma	1
11	1
Chapter	1
11	1
Alma	1
111	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
or	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
judges	1
should	1
receive	1
wages	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
they	1
labored	1
to	1
judge	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
brought	1
before	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
Alma	1
112	1
2	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
owed	1
another	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
owe	1
he	1
was	1
complained	1
of	1
to	1
the	1
judge	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
executed	1
authority	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
officers	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
the	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
evidences	1
which	1
were	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
pay	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
owed	1
or	1
be	1
stripped	1
or	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber	1
Alma	1
113	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
judge	1
received	1
for	1
his	1
wages	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
timea	1
senine	1
of	1
gold	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
a	1
senum	1
of	1
silver	1
which	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
senine	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
Alma	1
114	1
4	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
pieces	1
of	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
silver	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
value	1
And	1
the	1
names	1
are	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
reckon	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
measure	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
but	1
they	1
altered	1
their	1
reckoning	1
and	1
their	1
measure	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
every	1
generation	1
until	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
they	1
having	1
been	1
established	1
by	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
Alma	1
115	1
5	1
Now	1
the	1
reckoning	1
is	1
thusa	1
senine	1
of	1
gold	1
a	1
seon	1
of	1
gold	1
a	1
shum	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
a	1
limnah	1
of	1
gold	1
Alma	1
116	1
6	1
A	1
senum	1
of	1
silver	1
an	1
amnor	1
of	1
silver	1
an	1
ezrom	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
an	1
onti	1
of	1
silver	1
Alma	1
117	1
7	1
A	1
senum	1
of	1
silver	1
was	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
senine	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
either	1
for	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
barley	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
grain	1
Alma	1
118	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
a	1
seon	1
of	1
gold	1
was	1
twice	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
senine	1
Alma	1
119	1
9	1
And	1
a	1
shum	1
of	1
gold	1
was	1
twice	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
seon	1
Alma	1
1110	1
10	1
And	1
a	1
limnah	1
of	1
gold	1
was	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
Alma	1
1111	1
11	1
And	1
an	1
amnor	1
of	1
silver	1
was	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
two	1
senums	1
Alma	1
1112	1
12	1
And	1
an	1
ezrom	1
of	1
silver	1
was	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
four	1
senums	1
Alma	1
1113	1
13	1
And	1
an	1
onti	1
was	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
them	1
all	1
Alma	1
1114	1
14	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
lesser	1
numbers	1
of	1
their	1
reckoning	1
Alma	1
1115	1
15	1
A	1
shiblon	1
is	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
senum	1
therefore	1
a	1
shiblon	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
barley	1
Alma	1
1116	1
16	1
And	1
a	1
shiblum	1
is	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
shiblon	1
Alma	1
1117	1
17	1
And	1
a	1
leah	1
is	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
shiblum	1
Alma	1
1118	1
18	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
their	1
number	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
reckoning	1
Alma	1
1119	1
19	1
Now	1
an	1
antion	1
of	1
gold	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
three	1
shiblons	1
Alma	1
1120	1
20	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
purpose	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
because	1
they	1
received	1
their	1
wages	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
employ	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
riotings	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disturbances	1
and	1
wickedness	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
more	1
employ	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
suits	1
which	1
were	1
brought	1
before	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
Alma	1
1121	1
21	1
And	1
this	1
Zeezrom	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
Amulek	1
saying	1
Will	1
ye	1
answer	1
me	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
ask	1
you	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
expert	1
in	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Amulek	1
Will	1
ye	1
answer	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
1122	1
22	1
And	1
Amulek	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
nothing	1
which	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
here	1
are	1
six	1
onties	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
deny	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
Supreme	1
Being	1
Alma	1
1123	1
23	1
Now	1
Amulek	1
said	1
O	1
thou	1
child	1
of	1
hell	1
why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
yieldeth	1
to	1
no	1
such	1
temptations	1
Alma	1
1124	1
24	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
but	1
thou	1
lovest	1
that	1
lucre	1
more	1
than	1
him	1
Alma	1
1125	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
thou	1
hast	1
lied	1
before	1
God	1
unto	1
me	1
Thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
meBehold	1
these	1
six	1
onties	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
theewhen	1
thou	1
hadst	1
it	1
in	1
thy	1
heart	1
to	1
retain	1
them	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
thy	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
deny	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
for	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
thy	1
reward	1
Alma	1
1126	1
26	1
And	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
Alma	1
1127	1
27	1
And	1
Amulek	1
said	1
Yea	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
Alma	1
1128	1
28	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
Is	1
there	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
God	1
Alma	1
1129	1
29	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
No	1
Alma	1
1130	1
30	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
1131	1
31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
An	1
angel	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
Alma	1
1132	1
32	1
And	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
again	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
Is	1
it	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
1133	1
33	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
Alma	1
1134	1
34	1
And	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
again	1
Shall	1
he	1
save	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
And	1
Amulek	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
deny	1
his	1
word	1
Alma	1
1135	1
35	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
God	1
yet	1
he	1
saith	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
his	1
peopleas	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
authority	1
to	1
command	1
God	1
Alma	1
1136	1
36	1
Now	1
Amulek	1
saith	1
again	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
thou	1
hast	1
lied	1
for	1
thou	1
sayest	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
authority	1
to	1
command	1
God	1
because	1
I	1
said	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
Alma	1
1137	1
37	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
save	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
deny	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing	1
can	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
therefore	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
be	1
saved	1
except	1
ye	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
Therefore	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
Alma	1
1138	1
38	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
saith	1
again	1
unto	1
him	1
Is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
very	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
Alma	1
1139	1
39	1
And	1
Amulek	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
of	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
in	1
them	1
are	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
Alma	1
1140	1
40	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
have	1
eternal	1
life	1
and	1
salvation	1
cometh	1
to	1
none	1
else	1
Alma	1
1141	1
41	1
Therefore	1
the	1
wicked	1
remain	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
redemption	1
made	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
loosing	1
of	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
all	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
Alma	1
1142	1
42	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
death	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
temporal	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Christ	1
shall	1
loose	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
this	1
temporal	1
death	1
that	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
from	1
this	1
temporal	1
death	1
Alma	1
1143	1
43	1
The	1
spirit	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
reunited	1
again	1
in	1
its	1
perfect	1
form	1
both	1
limb	1
and	1
joint	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
proper	1
frame	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
now	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
God	1
knowing	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
now	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
bright	1
recollection	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
guilt	1
Alma	1
1144	1
44	1
Now	1
this	1
restoration	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
all	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
both	1
bond	1
and	1
free	1
both	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
both	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
even	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
their	1
heads	1
be	1
lost	1
but	1
every	1
thing	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
perfect	1
frame	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
and	1
be	1
arraigned	1
before	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
and	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
Eternal	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
Alma	1
1145	1
45	1
Now	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
mortal	1
body	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
mortal	1
body	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
mortal	1
body	1
is	1
raised	1
to	1
an	1
immortal	1
body	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
death	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
death	1
unto	1
life	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
die	1
no	1
more	1
their	1
spirits	1
uniting	1
with	1
their	1
bodies	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
thus	1
the	1
whole	1
becoming	1
spiritual	1
and	1
immortal	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
see	1
corruption	1
Alma	1
1146	1
46	1
Now	1
when	1
Amulek	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
and	1
also	1
Zeezrom	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Amulek	1
or	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
Alma	1
12	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Alma	1
121	1
1	1
Now	1
Alma	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Amulek	1
had	1
silenced	1
Zeezrom	1
for	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
Amulek	1
had	1
caught	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
lying	1
and	1
deceiving	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
under	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
guilt	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Amulek	1
and	1
to	1
explain	1
things	1
beyond	1
or	1
to	1
unfold	1
the	1
scriptures	1
beyond	1
that	1
which	1
Amulek	1
had	1
done	1
Alma	1
122	1
2	1
Now	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
Alma	1
spake	1
unto	1
Zeezrom	1
were	1
heard	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
was	1
great	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
Alma	1
123	1
3	1
Now	1
Zeezrom	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
thy	1
lying	1
and	1
craftiness	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
lied	1
unto	1
men	1
only	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
lied	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
knows	1
all	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
and	1
thou	1
seest	1
that	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
are	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
Alma	1
124	1
4	1
And	1
thou	1
seest	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thy	1
plan	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
subtle	1
plan	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
subtlety	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
to	1
deceive	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
set	1
them	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
revile	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
us	1
out	1
Alma	1
125	1
5	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
thine	1
adversary	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
exercised	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
thee	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
all	1
Alma	1
126	1
6	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
adversary	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
laid	1
to	1
catch	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
subjection	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
encircle	1
you	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
chains	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
chain	1
you	1
down	1
to	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
captivity	1
Alma	1
127	1
7	1
Now	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
Zeezrom	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
more	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
convinced	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
had	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
for	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
Alma	1
128	1
8	1
And	1
Zeezrom	1
began	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
them	1
diligently	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
more	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
What	1
does	1
this	1
mean	1
which	1
Amulek	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
that	1
all	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
both	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
the	1
unjust	1
and	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
Alma	1
129	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
Alma	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
It	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
many	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
are	1
laid	1
under	1
a	1
strict	1
command	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
impart	1
only	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
doth	1
grant	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
heed	1
and	1
diligence	1
which	1
they	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
1210	1
10	1
And	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
harden	1
his	1
heart	1
the	1
same	1
receiveth	1
the	1
lesser	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
harden	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
him	1
is	1
given	1
the	1
greater	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
until	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
until	1
he	1
know	1
them	1
in	1
full	1
Alma	1
1211	1
11	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
will	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
them	1
is	1
given	1
the	1
lesser	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
until	1
they	1
know	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
his	1
mysteries	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
led	1
by	1
his	1
will	1
down	1
to	1
destruction	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
Alma	1
1212	1
12	1
And	1
Amulek	1
hath	1
spoken	1
plainly	1
concerning	1
death	1
and	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
this	1
mortality	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
immortality	1
and	1
being	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
works	1
Alma	1
1213	1
13	1
Then	1
if	1
our	1
hearts	1
have	1
been	1
hardened	1
yea	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
hardened	1
our	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
insomuch	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
us	1
then	1
will	1
our	1
state	1
be	1
awful	1
for	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
condemned	1
Alma	1
1214	1
14	1
For	1
our	1
words	1
will	1
condemn	1
us	1
yea	1
all	1
our	1
works	1
will	1
condemn	1
us	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
spotless	1
and	1
our	1
thoughts	1
will	1
also	1
condemn	1
us	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
awful	1
state	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
we	1
would	1
fain	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
command	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
to	1
hide	1
us	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
Alma	1
1215	1
15	1
But	1
this	1
cannot	1
be	1
we	1
must	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
might	1
majesty	1
and	1
dominion	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
our	1
everlasting	1
shame	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
judgments	1
are	1
just	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
merciful	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
all	1
power	1
to	1
save	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
1216	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
then	1
cometh	1
a	1
death	1
even	1
a	1
second	1
death	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
death	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
that	1
whosoever	1
dieth	1
in	1
his	1
sins	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
temporal	1
death	1
shall	1
also	1
die	1
a	1
spiritual	1
death	1
yea	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
pertaining	1
unto	1
righteousness	1
Alma	1
1217	1
17	1
Then	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
their	1
torments	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
whose	1
flame	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
chained	1
down	1
to	1
an	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
captivity	1
of	1
Satan	1
he	1
having	1
subjected	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
Alma	1
1218	1
18	1
Then	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
redemption	1
made	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
redeemed	1
according	1
to	1
Gods	1
justice	1
and	1
they	1
cannot	1
die	1
seeing	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
corruption	1
Alma	1
1219	1
19	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
astonished	1
Alma	1
1220	1
20	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Antionah	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
chief	1
ruler	1
among	1
them	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
be	1
changed	1
from	1
this	1
mortal	1
to	1
an	1
immortal	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
can	1
never	1
die	1
Alma	1
1221	1
21	1
What	1
does	1
the	1
scripture	1
mean	1
which	1
saith	1
that	1
God	1
placed	1
cherubim	1
and	1
a	1
flaming	1
sword	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
lest	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
should	1
enter	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
live	1
forever	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possible	1
chance	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
live	1
forever	1
Alma	1
1222	1
22	1
Now	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
explain	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
Adam	1
did	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
fall	1
all	1
mankind	1
became	1
a	1
lost	1
and	1
fallen	1
people	1
Alma	1
1223	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible	1
for	1
Adam	1
to	1
have	1
partaken	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
void	1
making	1
God	1
a	1
liar	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
If	1
thou	1
eat	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die	1
Alma	1
1224	1
24	1
And	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
death	1
comes	1
upon	1
mankind	1
yea	1
the	1
death	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Amulek	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
temporal	1
death	1
nevertheless	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
space	1
granted	1
unto	1
man	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
repent	1
therefore	1
this	1
life	1
became	1
a	1
probationary	1
state	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
God	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
that	1
endless	1
state	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
us	1
which	1
is	1
after	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
Alma	1
1225	1
25	1
Now	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
was	1
laid	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
there	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
laid	1
which	1
shall	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
Alma	1
1226	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
could	1
have	1
gone	1
forth	1
and	1
partaken	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
forever	1
miserable	1
having	1
no	1
preparatory	1
state	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
frustrated	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
void	1
taking	1
none	1
effect	1
Alma	1
1227	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
die	1
and	1
after	1
death	1
they	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
judgment	1
even	1
that	1
same	1
judgment	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
Alma	1
1228	1
28	1
And	1
after	1
God	1
had	1
appointed	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
man	1
behold	1
then	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
he	1
had	1
appointed	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
1229	1
29	1
Therefore	1
he	1
sent	1
angels	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
them	1
who	1
caused	1
men	1
to	1
behold	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
Alma	1
1230	1
30	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
therefore	1
God	1
conversed	1
with	1
men	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
repentance	1
and	1
their	1
holy	1
works	1
Alma	1
1231	1
31	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
gave	1
commandments	1
unto	1
men	1
they	1
having	1
first	1
transgressed	1
the	1
first	1
commandments	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
temporal	1
and	1
becoming	1
as	1
Gods	1
knowing	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
placing	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
act	1
or	1
being	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
act	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
wills	1
and	1
pleasures	1
whether	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
Alma	1
1232	1
32	1
Therefore	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
commandments	1
after	1
having	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
do	1
evil	1
the	1
penalty	1
thereof	1
being	1
a	1
second	1
death	1
which	1
was	1
an	1
everlasting	1
death	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
pertaining	1
unto	1
righteousness	1
for	1
on	1
such	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
for	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
justice	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
supreme	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
1233	1
33	1
But	1
God	1
did	1
call	1
on	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
was	1
laid	1
saying	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
you	1
through	1
mine	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
Son	1
Alma	1
1234	1
34	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
repenteth	1
and	1
hardeneth	1
not	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
claim	1
on	1
mercy	1
through	1
mine	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
Son	1
unto	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
these	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest	1
Alma	1
1235	1
35	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
harden	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
iniquity	1
behold	1
I	1
swear	1
in	1
my	1
wrath	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest	1
Alma	1
1236	1
36	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
harden	1
your	1
hearts	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
your	1
iniquity	1
provoketh	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
sendeth	1
down	1
his	1
wrath	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
provocation	1
yea	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
provocation	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
of	1
your	1
souls	1
therefore	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
unto	1
the	1
last	1
death	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
Alma	1
1237	1
37	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
seeing	1
we	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
let	1
us	1
repent	1
and	1
harden	1
not	1
our	1
hearts	1
that	1
we	1
provoke	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
pull	1
down	1
his	1
wrath	1
upon	1
us	1
in	1
these	1
his	1
second	1
commandments	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
prepared	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
Alma	1
13	1
Chapter	1
13	1
Alma	1
131	1
1	1
And	1
again	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
cite	1
your	1
minds	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
gave	1
these	1
commandments	1
unto	1
his	1
children	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
ordained	1
priests	1
after	1
his	1
holy	1
order	1
which	1
was	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
to	1
teach	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
132	1
2	1
And	1
those	1
priests	1
were	1
ordained	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
thereby	1
the	1
people	1
might	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
his	1
Son	1
for	1
redemption	1
Alma	1
133	1
3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
manner	1
after	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
ordainedbeing	1
called	1
and	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
and	1
good	1
works	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
being	1
left	1
to	1
choose	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
therefore	1
they	1
having	1
chosen	1
good	1
and	1
exercising	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
faith	1
are	1
called	1
with	1
a	1
holy	1
calling	1
yea	1
with	1
that	1
holy	1
calling	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
with	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
preparatory	1
redemption	1
for	1
such	1
Alma	1
134	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
this	1
holy	1
calling	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
while	1
others	1
would	1
reject	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
minds	1
while	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
this	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
as	1
great	1
privilege	1
as	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
135	1
5	1
Or	1
in	1
fine	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
standing	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
thus	1
this	1
holy	1
calling	1
being	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
being	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
the	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
Son	1
who	1
was	1
prepared	1
Alma	1
136	1
6	1
And	1
thus	1
being	1
called	1
by	1
this	1
holy	1
calling	1
and	1
ordained	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priesthood	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
teach	1
his	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest	1
Alma	1
137	1
7	1
This	1
high	1
priesthood	1
being	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
which	1
order	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
being	1
without	1
beginning	1
of	1
days	1
or	1
end	1
of	1
years	1
being	1
prepared	1
from	1
eternity	1
to	1
all	1
eternity	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
Alma	1
138	1
8	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
ordained	1
after	1
this	1
mannerbeing	1
called	1
with	1
a	1
holy	1
calling	1
and	1
ordained	1
with	1
a	1
holy	1
ordinance	1
and	1
taking	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
high	1
priesthood	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
which	1
calling	1
and	1
ordinance	1
and	1
high	1
priesthood	1
is	1
without	1
beginning	1
or	1
end	1
Alma	1
139	1
9	1
Thus	1
they	1
become	1
high	1
priests	1
forever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
the	1
Only	1
Begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
who	1
is	1
without	1
beginning	1
of	1
days	1
or	1
end	1
of	1
years	1
who	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
equity	1
and	1
truth	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
Amen	1
Alma	1
1310	1

Now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
concerning	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
or	1
this	1
high	1
priesthood	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
were	1
ordained	1
and	1
became	1
high	1
priests	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
and	1
repentance	1
and	1
their	1
righteousness	1
before	1
God	1
they	1
choosing	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
work	1
righteousness	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
perish	1
Alma	1
1311	1
11	1
Therefore	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
after	1
this	1
holy	1
order	1
and	1
were	1
sanctified	1
and	1
their	1
garments	1
were	1
washed	1
white	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
Alma	1
1312	1
12	1
Now	1
they	1
after	1
being	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
having	1
their	1
garments	1
made	1
white	1
being	1
pure	1
and	1
spotless	1
before	1
God	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1
sin	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
abhorrence	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
many	1
who	1
were	1
made	1
pure	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
1313	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
also	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
rest	1
Alma	1
1314	1
14	1
Yea	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Melchizedek	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
high	1
priest	1
after	1
this	1
same	1
order	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
who	1
also	1
took	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
high	1
priesthood	1
forever	1
Alma	1
1315	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
same	1
Melchizedek	1
to	1
whom	1
Abraham	1
paid	1
tithes	1
yea	1
even	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham	1
paid	1
tithes	1
of	1
onetenth	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
possessed	1
Alma	1
1316	1
16	1
Now	1
these	1
ordinances	1
were	1
given	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
that	1
thereby	1
the	1
people	1
might	1
look	1
forward	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
his	1
order	1
or	1
it	1
being	1
his	1
order	1
and	1
this	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
1317	1
17	1
Now	1
this	1
Melchizedek	1
was	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Salem	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
had	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
iniquity	1
and	1
abomination	1
yea	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
astray	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
Alma	1
1318	1
18	1
But	1
Melchizedek	1
having	1
exercised	1
mighty	1
faith	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priesthood	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
preach	1
repentance	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
and	1
Melchizedek	1
did	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
his	1
days	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
peace	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Salem	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
reign	1
under	1
his	1
father	1
Alma	1
1319	1
19	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
afterwards	1
but	1
none	1
were	1
greater	1
therefore	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
have	1
more	1
particularly	1
made	1
mention	1
Alma	1
1320	1
20	1
Now	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
rehearse	1
the	1
matter	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
may	1
suffice	1
Behold	1
the	1
scriptures	1
are	1
before	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
wrest	1
them	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
1321	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
voice	1
saying	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
repent	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
Alma	1
1322	1
22	1
Yea	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
angels	1
doth	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
all	1
nations	1
yea	1
doth	1
declare	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
sound	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
wherefore	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
Alma	1
1323	1
23	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
plain	1
terms	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
understand	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
err	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
being	1
wanderers	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1
therefore	1
we	1
are	1
thus	1
highly	1
favored	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
our	1
vineyard	1
Alma	1
1324	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
angels	1
are	1
declaring	1
it	1
unto	1
many	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
our	1
land	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
preparing	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
word	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
in	1
his	1
glory	1
Alma	1
1325	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
only	1
wait	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
joyful	1
news	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
angels	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
soon	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
day	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
Alma	1
1326	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
just	1
and	1
holy	1
men	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
angels	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
him	1
which	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
Alma	1
1327	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
wish	1
from	1
the	1
inmost	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
yea	1
with	1
great	1
anxiety	1
even	1
unto	1
pain	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
cast	1
off	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
not	1
procrastinate	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
1328	1
28	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
holy	1
name	1
and	1
watch	1
and	1
pray	1
continually	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
tempted	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
can	1
bear	1
and	1
thus	1
be	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
becoming	1
humble	1
meek	1
submissive	1
patient	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
Alma	1
1329	1
29	1
Having	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
having	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
eternal	1
life	1
having	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
always	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest	1
Alma	1
1330	1
30	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
repentance	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
bring	1
down	1
his	1
wrath	1
upon	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
bound	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
Alma	1
1331	1
31	1
And	1
Alma	1
spake	1
many	1
more	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
Alma	1
14	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Alma	1
141	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
scriptures	1
Alma	1
142	1
2	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
Alma	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
unto	1
Zeezrom	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
said	1
that	1
Amulek	1
had	1
lied	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
reviled	1
against	1
their	1
law	1
and	1
also	1
against	1
their	1
lawyers	1
and	1
judges	1
Alma	1
143	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
angry	1
with	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
testified	1
so	1
plainly	1
against	1
their	1
wickedness	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
away	1
privily	1
Alma	1
144	1
4	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
but	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
and	1
bound	1
them	1
with	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
145	1
5	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
witnessed	1
against	1
themtestifying	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
reviled	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
their	1
lawyers	1
and	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
also	1
testified	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
send	1
his	1
Son	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
but	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
things	1
did	1
the	1
people	1
testify	1
against	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
before	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
146	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zeezrom	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
concerning	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
the	1
minds	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
his	1
lying	1
words	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
harrowed	1
up	1
under	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guilt	1
yea	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
encircled	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
Alma	1
147	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
saying	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
guilty	1
and	1
these	1
men	1
are	1
spotless	1
before	1
God	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
plead	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
but	1
they	1
reviled	1
him	1
saying	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
And	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
and	1
sent	1
men	1
to	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
them	1
Alma	1
148	1
8	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
together	1
and	1
whosoever	1
believed	1
or	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
brought	1
forth	1
their	1
records	1
which	1
contained	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
burned	1
and	1
destroyed	1
by	1
fire	1
Alma	1
149	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
martyrdom	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
witness	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
consumed	1
by	1
fire	1
Alma	1
1410	1
10	1
And	1
when	1
Amulek	1
saw	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
consuming	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
also	1
was	1
pained	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
How	1
can	1
we	1
witness	1
this	1
awful	1
scene	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
stretch	1
forth	1
our	1
hands	1
and	1
exercise	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
us	1
and	1
save	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
flames	1
Alma	1
1411	1
11	1
But	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
The	1
Spirit	1
constraineth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
receiveth	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
himself	1
in	1
glory	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
suffer	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
exercise	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
may	1
be	1
just	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
innocent	1
shall	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
against	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
1412	1
12	1
Now	1
Amulek	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
Behold	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
burn	1
us	1
also	1
Alma	1
1413	1
13	1
And	1
Alma	1
said	1
Be	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
But	1
behold	1
our	1
work	1
is	1
not	1
finished	1
therefore	1
they	1
burn	1
us	1
not	1
Alma	1
1414	1
14	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
were	1
consumed	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
cast	1
in	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
their	1
cheeks	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
After	1
what	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
will	1
ye	1
preach	1
again	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
Alma	1
1415	1
15	1
Behold	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
save	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
neither	1
has	1
God	1
saved	1
them	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
And	1
the	1
judge	1
smote	1
them	1
again	1
upon	1
their	1
cheeks	1
and	1
asked	1
What	1
say	1
ye	1
for	1
yourselves	1
Alma	1
1416	1
16	1
Now	1
this	1
judge	1
was	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
faith	1
of	1
Nehor	1
who	1
slew	1
Gideon	1
Alma	1
1417	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
answered	1
him	1
nothing	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
Alma	1
1418	1
18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
three	1
days	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
lawyers	1
and	1
judges	1
and	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
Nehor	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
questioned	1
them	1
about	1
many	1
words	1
but	1
they	1
answered	1
them	1
nothing	1
Alma	1
1419	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
judge	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
said	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
flames	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
they	1
answered	1
nothing	1
Alma	1
1420	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
but	1
came	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
also	1
smote	1
them	1
again	1
on	1
their	1
cheeks	1
And	1
many	1
came	1
forth	1
also	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
saying	1
Will	1
ye	1
stand	1
again	1
and	1
judge	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
condemn	1
our	1
law	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
deliver	1
yourselves	1
Alma	1
1421	1
21	1
And	1
many	1
such	1
things	1
did	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
gnashing	1
their	1
teeth	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
spitting	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
saying	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
look	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
damned	1
Alma	1
1422	1
22	1
And	1
many	1
such	1
things	1
yea	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
did	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
mock	1
them	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
withhold	1
food	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
hunger	1
and	1
water	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
thirst	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
did	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
their	1
clothes	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
naked	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
with	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
confined	1
in	1
prison	1
Alma	1
1423	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
thus	1
suffered	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
twelfth	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
teachers	1
and	1
their	1
lawyers	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
prison	1
where	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
were	1
bound	1
with	1
cords	1
Alma	1
1424	1
24	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
deliver	1
yourselves	1
from	1
these	1
bands	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
words	1
Alma	1
1425	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
last	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
and	1
they	1
rose	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
their	1
feet	1
Alma	1
1426	1
26	1
And	1
Alma	1
cried	1
saying	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
we	1
suffer	1
these	1
great	1
afflictions	1
O	1
Lord	1
O	1
Lord	1
give	1
us	1
strength	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
even	1
unto	1
deliverance	1
And	1
they	1
broke	1
the	1
cords	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
this	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
destruction	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
1427	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
fear	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
obtain	1
the	1
outer	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
mightily	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
the	1
lawyers	1
and	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
who	1
smote	1
upon	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
fall	1
thereof	1
Alma	1
1428	1
28	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
hurt	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Christ	1
And	1
they	1
straightway	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
loosed	1
from	1
their	1
bands	1
and	1
the	1
prison	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
every	1
soul	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
was	1
slain	1
and	1
they	1
straightway	1
came	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
1429	1
29	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
having	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
noise	1
came	1
running	1
together	1
by	1
multitudes	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
coming	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
they	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
great	1
fear	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
goat	1
fleeth	1
with	1
her	1
young	1
from	1
two	1
lions	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
Alma	1
15	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Alma	1
151	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
were	1
commanded	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
and	1
they	1
departed	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sidom	1
and	1
behold	1
there	1
they	1
found	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
stoned	1
because	1
they	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
152	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
related	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
themselves	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
power	1
of	1
deliverance	1
Alma	1
153	1
3	1
And	1
also	1
Zeezrom	1
lay	1
sick	1
at	1
Sidom	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
fever	1
which	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
tribulations	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness	1
for	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
iniquity	1
And	1
this	1
great	1
sin	1
and	1
his	1
many	1
other	1
sins	1
did	1
harrow	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
until	1
it	1
did	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
having	1
no	1
deliverance	1
therefore	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
scorched	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
heat	1
Alma	1
154	1
4	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sidom	1
his	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
courage	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
immediately	1
unto	1
them	1
desiring	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
155	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
immediately	1
obeying	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
unto	1
Zeezrom	1
and	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
bed	1
sick	1
being	1
very	1
low	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
fever	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
also	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
iniquities	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
besought	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
heal	1
him	1
Alma	1
156	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
Believest	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
salvation	1
Alma	1
157	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
Alma	1
158	1
8	1
And	1
Alma	1
said	1
If	1
thou	1
believest	1
in	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
Christ	1
thou	1
canst	1
be	1
healed	1
Alma	1
159	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words	1
Alma	1
1510	1
10	1
And	1
then	1
Alma	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
heal	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
1511	1
11	1
And	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
Zeezrom	1
leaped	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
astonishment	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
went	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sidom	1
Alma	1
1512	1
12	1
And	1
Alma	1
baptized	1
Zeezrom	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
1513	1
13	1
And	1
Alma	1
established	1
a	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sidom	1
and	1
consecrated	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
baptize	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
whosoever	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
Alma	1
1514	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
many	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
flock	1
in	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Sidom	1
and	1
were	1
baptized	1
Alma	1
1515	1
15	1
But	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
they	1
yet	1
remained	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
and	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
ascribing	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
Nehor	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
repentance	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
Alma	1
1516	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
Amulek	1
having	1
forsaken	1
all	1
his	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
his	1
precious	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
being	1
rejected	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
kindred	1
Alma	1
1517	1
17	1
Therefore	1
after	1
Alma	1
having	1
established	1
the	1
church	1
at	1
Sidom	1
seeing	1
a	1
great	1
check	1
yea	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
checked	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
their	1
sanctuaries	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
watching	1
and	1
praying	1
continually	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
Satan	1
and	1
from	1
death	1
and	1
from	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
1518	1
18	1
Now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
Alma	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
therefore	1
he	1
took	1
Amulek	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
administer	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
tribulations	1
and	1
strengthened	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
1519	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
16	1
Chapter	1
16	1
Alma	1
161	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
much	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
no	1
wars	1
nor	1
contentions	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
war	1
heard	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
162	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
wilderness	1
side	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
163	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
before	1
the	1
Nephites	1
could	1
raise	1
a	1
sufficient	1
army	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
they	1
had	1
destroyed	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
also	1
some	1
around	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Noah	1
and	1
taken	1
others	1
captive	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
164	1
4	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
obtain	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
165	1
5	1
Therefore	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Zoram	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
sons	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Ahanow	1
Zoram	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
sons	1
knowing	1
that	1
Alma	1
was	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
whither	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
166	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
And	1
Alma	1
returned	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
will	1
cross	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
wilderness	1
away	1
up	1
beyond	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
meet	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
deliver	1
unto	1
thee	1
thy	1
brethren	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
167	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zoram	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
crossed	1
over	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
and	1
marched	1
away	1
beyond	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Manti	1
into	1
the	1
south	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
168	1
8	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
scattered	1
and	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
soul	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
captive	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
by	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
possess	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
Alma	1
169	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
having	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
were	1
destroyed	1
yea	1
every	1
living	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonihahites	1
was	1
destroyed	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
great	1
city	1
which	1
they	1
said	1
God	1
could	1
not	1
destroy	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
greatness	1
Alma	1
1610	1
10	1
But	1
behold	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
desolate	1
and	1
the	1
carcasses	1
were	1
mangled	1
by	1
dogs	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
1611	1
11	1
Nevertheless	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
were	1
heaped	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
shallow	1
covering	1
And	1
now	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Desolation	1
of	1
Nehors	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
Nehor	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
their	1
lands	1
remained	1
desolate	1
Alma	1
1612	1
12	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
until	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
thus	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
did	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
have	1
continual	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
1613	1
13	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
went	1
forth	1
preaching	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
temples	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
sanctuaries	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues	1
which	1
were	1
built	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
Alma	1
1614	1
14	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
hear	1
their	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
they	1
did	1
impart	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
any	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
continually	1
Alma	1
1615	1
15	1
And	1
thus	1
did	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
more	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
became	1
general	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
1616	1
16	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
inequality	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
to	1
prepare	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
taught	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
Alma	1
1617	1
17	1
That	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
hardened	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
unbelieving	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
destruction	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
branch	1
be	1
grafted	1
into	1
the	1
true	1
vine	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
1618	1
18	1
Now	1
those	1
priests	1
who	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
preach	1
against	1
all	1
lyings	1
and	1
deceivings	1
and	1
envyings	1
and	1
strifes	1
and	1
malice	1
and	1
revilings	1
and	1
stealing	1
robbing	1
plundering	1
murdering	1
committing	1
adultery	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
lasciviousness	1
crying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
Alma	1
1619	1
19	1
Holding	1
forth	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
yea	1
holding	1
forth	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
Alma	1
1620	1
20	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
inquire	1
concerning	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
appear	1
unto	1
them	1
after	1
his	1
resurrection	1
and	1
this	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
hear	1
with	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
Alma	1
1621	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
after	1
the	1
church	1
had	1
been	1
established	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
landhaving	1
got	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
being	1
preached	1
in	1
its	1
purity	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
pouring	1
out	1
his	1
blessings	1
upon	1
the	1
peoplethus	1
ended	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
17	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Alma	1
171	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
Alma	1
was	1
journeying	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
southward	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
behold	1
to	1
his	1
astonishment	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
journeying	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
172	1
2	1
Now	1
these	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
were	1
with	1
Alma	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
angel	1
first	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
therefore	1
Alma	1
did	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
what	1
added	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
joy	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
his	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
understanding	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
diligently	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
173	1
3	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
themselves	1
to	1
much	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting	1
therefore	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
taught	1
they	1
taught	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
174	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
fourteen	1
years	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
having	1
had	1
much	1
success	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
yea	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
words	1
many	1
were	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
confess	1
their	1
sins	1
before	1
him	1
Alma	1
175	1
5	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
attended	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
journeyings	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
many	1
afflictions	1
they	1
did	1
suffer	1
much	1
both	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
mind	1
such	1
as	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
fatigue	1
and	1
also	1
much	1
labor	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
Alma	1
176	1
6	1
Now	1
these	1
were	1
their	1
journeyings	1
Having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
Mosiah	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
having	1
refused	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
their	1
father	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
confer	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
177	1
7	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
their	1
spears	1
and	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
their	1
arrows	1
and	1
their	1
slings	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
provide	1
food	1
for	1
themselves	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
178	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
their	1
numbers	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
selected	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
179	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
journeyed	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
they	1
fasted	1
much	1
and	1
prayed	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
abide	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
bring	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
baseness	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
correct	1
Alma	1
1710	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
visit	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
Spirit	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Be	1
comforted	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
comforted	1
Alma	1
1711	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
also	1
Go	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
thy	1
brethren	1
and	1
establish	1
my	1
word	1
yet	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
patient	1
in	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
afflictions	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
show	1
forth	1
good	1
examples	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
many	1
souls	1
Alma	1
1712	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
them	1
took	1
courage	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
1713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
separated	1
themselves	1
and	1
departed	1
one	1
from	1
another	1
trusting	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
their	1
harvest	1
for	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
undertaken	1
Alma	1
1714	1
14	1
And	1
assuredly	1
it	1
was	1
great	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
undertaken	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
a	1
wild	1
and	1
a	1
hardened	1
and	1
a	1
ferocious	1
people	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
delighted	1
in	1
murdering	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
robbing	1
and	1
plundering	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
set	1
upon	1
riches	1
or	1
upon	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
yet	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
obtain	1
these	1
things	1
by	1
murdering	1
and	1
plundering	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
labor	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
Alma	1
1715	1
15	1
Thus	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
very	1
indolent	1
people	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
did	1
worship	1
idols	1
and	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
were	1
extended	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
1716	1
16	1
Therefore	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
had	1
undertaken	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
perhaps	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
perhaps	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
Alma	1
1717	1
17	1
Therefore	1
they	1
separated	1
themselves	1
one	1
from	1
another	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
every	1
man	1
alone	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
1718	1
18	1
Now	1
Ammon	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
among	1
them	1
or	1
rather	1
he	1
did	1
administer	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
after	1
having	1
blessed	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
several	1
stations	1
having	1
imparted	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
or	1
administered	1
unto	1
them	1
before	1
his	1
departure	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
several	1
journeys	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
1719	1
19	1
And	1
Ammon	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
land	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
who	1
also	1
became	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
1720	1
20	1
And	1
as	1
Ammon	1
entered	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
as	1
was	1
their	1
custom	1
to	1
bind	1
all	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
fell	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
retain	1
them	1
in	1
captivity	1
or	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison	1
or	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
Alma	1
1721	1
21	1
And	1
thus	1
Ammon	1
was	1
carried	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
who	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Alma	1
1722	1
22	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
inquired	1
of	1
Ammon	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
or	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
1723	1
23	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
dwell	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
yea	1
and	1
perhaps	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
die	1
Alma	1
1724	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
was	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
Ammon	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
bands	1
should	1
be	1
loosed	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
that	1
Ammon	1
should	1
take	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
daughters	1
to	1
wife	1
Alma	1
1725	1
25	1
But	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Nay	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servant	1
Therefore	1
Ammon	1
became	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
among	1
other	1
servants	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
1726	1
26	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
three	1
days	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanitish	1
servants	1
going	1
forth	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Sebus	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
drive	1
their	1
flocks	1
hither	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
water	1
Alma	1
1727	1
27	1
Therefore	1
as	1
Ammon	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
were	1
driving	1
forth	1
their	1
flocks	1
to	1
this	1
place	1
of	1
water	1
behold	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
to	1
water	1
stood	1
and	1
scattered	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
they	1
scattered	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
many	1
ways	1
Alma	1
1728	1
28	1
Now	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
saying	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
slay	1
us	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
our	1
brethren	1
because	1
their	1
flocks	1
were	1
scattered	1
by	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
exceedingly	1
saying	1
Behold	1
our	1
flocks	1
are	1
scattered	1
already	1
Alma	1
1729	1
29	1
Now	1
they	1
wept	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
slain	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
this	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
swollen	1
within	1
him	1
with	1
joy	1
for	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
forth	1
my	1
power	1
unto	1
these	1
my	1
fellowservants	1
or	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
in	1
restoring	1
these	1
flocks	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
win	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
these	1
my	1
fellowservants	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
words	1
Alma	1
1730	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Ammon	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
termed	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
1731	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
flattered	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
words	1
saying	1
My	1
brethren	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
back	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
will	1
preserve	1
the	1
flocks	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
slay	1
us	1
Alma	1
1732	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
follow	1
Ammon	1
and	1
they	1
rushed	1
forth	1
with	1
much	1
swiftness	1
and	1
did	1
head	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
did	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
water	1
Alma	1
1733	1
33	1
And	1
those	1
men	1
again	1
stood	1
to	1
scatter	1
their	1
flocks	1
but	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren	1
Encircle	1
the	1
flocks	1
round	1
about	1
that	1
they	1
flee	1
not	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
contend	1
with	1
these	1
men	1
who	1
do	1
scatter	1
our	1
flocks	1
Alma	1
1734	1
34	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
as	1
Ammon	1
commanded	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
stood	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sebus	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
Alma	1
1735	1
35	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
Ammon	1
for	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
men	1
could	1
slay	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
pleasure	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
promised	1
Mosiah	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
his	1
sons	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
know	1
anything	1
concerning	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
they	1
delighted	1
in	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
they	1
stood	1
to	1
scatter	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
1736	1
36	1
But	1
Ammon	1
stood	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
sling	1
yea	1
with	1
mighty	1
power	1
he	1
did	1
sling	1
stones	1
amongst	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
slew	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
power	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
determined	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
fall	1
therefore	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hit	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
stones	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
with	1
clubs	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
Alma	1
1737	1
37	1
But	1
behold	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
lifted	1
his	1
club	1
to	1
smite	1
Ammon	1
he	1
smote	1
off	1
their	1
arms	1
with	1
his	1
sword	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
withstand	1
their	1
blows	1
by	1
smiting	1
their	1
arms	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
him	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
few	1
in	1
number	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
flee	1
by	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
Alma	1
1738	1
38	1
Now	1
six	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sling	1
but	1
he	1
slew	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
their	1
leader	1
with	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
off	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
arms	1
as	1
were	1
lifted	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
Alma	1
1739	1
39	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
them	1
afar	1
off	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
they	1
watered	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
returned	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
pasture	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
bearing	1
the	1
arms	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
smitten	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Ammon	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
Alma	1
18	1
Chapter	1
18	1
Alma	1
181	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
should	1
stand	1
forth	1
and	1
testify	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
Alma	1
182	1
2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
faithfulness	1
of	1
Ammon	1
in	1
preserving	1
his	1
flocks	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
power	1
in	1
contending	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
said	1
Surely	1
this	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
Behold	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
who	1
doth	1
send	1
such	1
great	1
punishments	1
upon	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
murders	1
Alma	1
183	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
said	1
Whether	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
this	1
much	1
we	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
neither	1
can	1
they	1
scatter	1
the	1
kings	1
flocks	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
expertness	1
and	1
great	1
strength	1
therefore	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
king	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
slain	1
Alma	1
184	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
down	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
preserve	1
your	1
lives	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
slay	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
your	1
brethren	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
of	1
whom	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
spoken	1
Alma	1
185	1
5	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
believed	1
in	1
a	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
did	1
was	1
right	1
nevertheless	1
Lamoni	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
exceedingly	1
with	1
fear	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
wrong	1
in	1
slaying	1
his	1
servants	1
Alma	1
186	1
6	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
because	1
their	1
brethren	1
had	1
scattered	1
their	1
flocks	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
thus	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
their	1
flocks	1
scattered	1
they	1
were	1
slain	1
Alma	1
187	1
7	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
these	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sebus	1
to	1
scatter	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
drive	1
away	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
land	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
practice	1
of	1
plunder	1
among	1
them	1
Alma	1
188	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
inquired	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
saying	1
Where	1
is	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
Alma	1
189	1
9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
he	1
is	1
feeding	1
thy	1
horses	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
watering	1
of	1
their	1
flocks	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
prepare	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots	1
and	1
conduct	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
appointed	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
by	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
who	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
1810	1
10	1
Now	1
when	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
heard	1
that	1
Ammon	1
was	1
preparing	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
chariots	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
astonished	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
faithfulness	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saying	1
Surely	1
there	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
any	1
servant	1
among	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
faithful	1
as	1
this	1
man	1
for	1
even	1
he	1
doth	1
remember	1
all	1
my	1
commandments	1
to	1
execute	1
them	1
Alma	1
1811	1
11	1
Now	1
I	1
surely	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
durst	1
not	1
Alma	1
1812	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
chariots	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
changed	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
return	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
Alma	1
1813	1
13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Rabbanah	1
which	1
is	1
being	1
interpreted	1
powerful	1
or	1
great	1
king	1
considering	1
their	1
kings	1
to	1
be	1
powerful	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Rabbanah	1
the	1
king	1
desireth	1
thee	1
to	1
stay	1
Alma	1
1814	1
14	1
Therefore	1
Ammon	1
turned	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
for	1
thee	1
O	1
king	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
time	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
1815	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
What	1
desirest	1
thou	1
of	1
me	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
Alma	1
1816	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
therefore	1
he	1
perceived	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Is	1
it	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
defended	1
thy	1
servants	1
and	1
thy	1
flocks	1
and	1
slew	1
seven	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
with	1
the	1
sling	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
smote	1
off	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
defend	1
thy	1
flocks	1
and	1
thy	1
servants	1
behold	1
is	1
it	1
this	1
that	1
causeth	1
thy	1
marvelings	1
Alma	1
1817	1
17	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thy	1
marvelings	1
are	1
so	1
great	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
am	1
thy	1
servant	1
therefore	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
desirest	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
Alma	1
1818	1
18	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
marveled	1
again	1
for	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
Ammon	1
could	1
discern	1
his	1
thoughts	1
but	1
notwithstanding	1
this	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
did	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
who	1
knows	1
all	1
things	1
Alma	1
1819	1
19	1
Ammon	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
Alma	1
1820	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
Thou	1
mayest	1
speak	1
boldly	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
also	1
tell	1
me	1
by	1
what	1
power	1
ye	1
slew	1
and	1
smote	1
off	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
scattered	1
my	1
flocks	1
Alma	1
1821	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
tell	1
me	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
desirest	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
needed	1
I	1
would	1
guard	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
armies	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
all	1
they	1
nevertheless	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
desirest	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
Alma	1
1822	1
22	1
Now	1
Ammon	1
being	1
wise	1
yet	1
harmless	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Lamoni	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
if	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
by	1
what	1
power	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
desire	1
of	1
thee	1
Alma	1
1823	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
believe	1
all	1
thy	1
words	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
with	1
guile	1
Alma	1
1824	1
24	1
And	1
Ammon	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
boldness	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
Alma	1
1825	1
25	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
that	1
meaneth	1
Alma	1
1826	1
26	1
And	1
then	1
Ammon	1
said	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
Alma	1
1827	1
27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
Alma	1
1828	1
28	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
This	1
is	1
God	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
this	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
who	1
is	1
God	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
1829	1
29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
heavens	1
Alma	1
1830	1
30	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
The	1
heavens	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
God	1
dwells	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
holy	1
angels	1
Alma	1
1831	1
31	1
And	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
Is	1
it	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
1832	1
32	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
looketh	1
down	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
he	1
knows	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
for	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
created	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Alma	1
1833	1
33	1
And	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
Art	1
thou	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
Alma	1
1834	1
34	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
created	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
by	1
his	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
to	1
teach	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
Alma	1
1835	1
35	1
And	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
that	1
Spirit	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me	1
which	1
giveth	1
me	1
knowledge	1
and	1
also	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
faith	1
and	1
desires	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
God	1
Alma	1
1836	1
36	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
Adam	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
rehearsed	1
and	1
laid	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
Alma	1
1837	1
37	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
all	1
the	1
journeyings	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
sufferings	1
with	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
and	1
their	1
travail	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
Alma	1
1838	1
38	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
rebellions	1
of	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
yea	1
all	1
their	1
rebellions	1
did	1
he	1
relate	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
expounded	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
scriptures	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
Alma	1
1839	1
39	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
for	1
he	1
expounded	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
he	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
1840	1
40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
expounded	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
believed	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
Alma	1
1841	1
41	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
abundant	1
mercy	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
have	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
Alma	1
1842	1
42	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead	1
Alma	1
1843	1
43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
in	1
unto	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
upon	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
two	1
nights	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
mourned	1
over	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
greatly	1
lamenting	1
his	1
loss	1
Alma	1
19	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Alma	1
191	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
two	1
nights	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
burying	1
their	1
dead	1
Alma	1
192	1
2	1
Now	1
the	1
queen	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Ammon	1
therefore	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
desired	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
her	1
Alma	1
193	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
commanded	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
Alma	1
194	1
4	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
The	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
husband	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
a	1
holy	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
many	1
mighty	1
works	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
195	1
5	1
Therefore	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
husband	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
upon	1
his	1
bed	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
two	1
nights	1
and	1
some	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
dead	1
but	1
others	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
stinketh	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
myself	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
stink	1
Alma	1
196	1
6	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
Ammon	1
desired	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
dark	1
veil	1
of	1
unbelief	1
was	1
being	1
cast	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
did	1
light	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
marvelous	1
light	1
of	1
his	1
goodnessyea	1
this	1
light	1
had	1
infused	1
such	1
joy	1
into	1
his	1
soul	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
having	1
been	1
dispelled	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
yea	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
overcome	1
his	1
natural	1
frame	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
God	1
Alma	1
197	1
7	1
Therefore	1
what	1
the	1
queen	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
only	1
desire	1
Therefore	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
king	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
queen	1
had	1
desired	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
Alma	1
198	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
dead	1
but	1
he	1
sleepeth	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
therefore	1
bury	1
him	1
not	1
Alma	1
199	1
9	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
witness	1
save	1
thy	1
word	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
our	1
servants	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
Alma	1
1910	1
10	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
woman	1
there	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
such	1
great	1
faith	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
1911	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
watched	1
over	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
even	1
until	1
that	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
which	1
Ammon	1
had	1
appointed	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rise	1
Alma	1
1912	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
arose	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
arose	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
said	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Alma	1
1913	1
13	1
For	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
thou	1
livest	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
Redeemer	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
redeem	1
all	1
mankind	1
who	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
swollen	1
within	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
sunk	1
again	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
also	1
sunk	1
down	1
being	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
Alma	1
1914	1
14	1
Now	1
Ammon	1
seeing	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
poured	1
out	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
prayers	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
his	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
mourning	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
or	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
their	1
traditions	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
overpowered	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
1915	1
15	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
they	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
also	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
testified	1
unto	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
Ammon	1
Alma	1
1916	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
their	1
might	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanitish	1
women	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Abish	1
she	1
having	1
been	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
a	1
remarkable	1
vision	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
Alma	1
1917	1
17	1
Thus	1
having	1
been	1
converted	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
never	1
having	1
made	1
it	1
known	1
therefore	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
also	1
her	1
mistress	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Ammon	1
lay	1
prostrate	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
this	1
opportunity	1
by	1
making	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
by	1
beholding	1
this	1
scene	1
it	1
would	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
therefore	1
she	1
ran	1
forth	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
making	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
1918	1
18	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
multitude	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
astonishment	1
they	1
beheld	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
their	1
servants	1
prostrate	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
lay	1
there	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
saw	1
Ammon	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Nephite	1
Alma	1
1919	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
murmur	1
among	1
themselves	1
some	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
evil	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
house	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
that	1
the	1
Nephite	1
should	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
1920	1
20	1
But	1
others	1
rebuked	1
them	1
saying	1
The	1
king	1
hath	1
brought	1
this	1
evil	1
upon	1
his	1
house	1
because	1
he	1
slew	1
his	1
servants	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
their	1
flocks	1
scattered	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sebus	1
Alma	1
1921	1
21	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
rebuked	1
by	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sebus	1
and	1
scattered	1
the	1
flocks	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
Ammon	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sebus	1
while	1
defending	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
1922	1
22	1
Now	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
whose	1
brother	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Ammon	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
with	1
Ammon	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
let	1
it	1
fall	1
upon	1
Ammon	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
lifted	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
behold	1
he	1
fell	1
dead	1
Alma	1
1923	1
23	1
Now	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
Ammon	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Mosiah	1
his	1
father	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
faiththerefore	1
Mosiah	1
trusted	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
1924	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
multitude	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
fallen	1
dead	1
who	1
lifted	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
slay	1
Ammon	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hands	1
to	1
touch	1
him	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
marvel	1
again	1
among	1
themselves	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
power	1
or	1
what	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
could	1
mean	1
Alma	1
1925	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
Ammon	1
was	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
and	1
others	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
Alma	1
1926	1
26	1
But	1
others	1
rebuked	1
them	1
all	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
monster	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
torment	1
them	1
Alma	1
1927	1
27	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
Ammon	1
was	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
to	1
afflict	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
that	1
had	1
always	1
attended	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
who	1
had	1
destroyed	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
1928	1
28	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
contention	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
sharp	1
among	1
them	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
contending	1
the	1
woman	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
came	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
contention	1
which	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
multitude	1
she	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
even	1
unto	1
tears	1
Alma	1
1929	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
queen	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
perhaps	1
she	1
might	1
raise	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
touched	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
O	1
blessed	1
Jesus	1
who	1
has	1
saved	1
me	1
from	1
an	1
awful	1
hell	1
O	1
blessed	1
God	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
this	1
people	1
Alma	1
1930	1
30	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
speaking	1
many	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
Alma	1
1931	1
31	1
And	1
he	1
immediately	1
seeing	1
the	1
contention	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
believed	1
and	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
1932	1
32	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way	1
Alma	1
1933	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Ammon	1
arose	1
he	1
also	1
administered	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
declare	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
selfsame	1
thingthat	1
their	1
hearts	1
had	1
been	1
changed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
Alma	1
1934	1
34	1
And	1
behold	1
many	1
did	1
declare	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
angels	1
and	1
had	1
conversed	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
righteousness	1
Alma	1
1935	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
that	1
did	1
believe	1
in	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
did	1
believe	1
were	1
baptized	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
establish	1
a	1
church	1
among	1
them	1
Alma	1
1936	1
36	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
commence	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
thus	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
arm	1
is	1
extended	1
to	1
all	1
people	1
who	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
20	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Alma	1
201	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
established	1
a	1
church	1
in	1
that	1
land	1
that	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
desired	1
that	1
Ammon	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
show	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
Alma	1
202	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
to	1
Ammon	1
saying	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
seek	1
thy	1
life	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
for	1
behold	1
thy	1
brother	1
Aaron	1
and	1
also	1
Muloki	1
and	1
Ammah	1
are	1
in	1
prison	1
Alma	1
203	1
3	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Lamoni	1
Behold	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
brethren	1
are	1
in	1
prison	1
at	1
Middoni	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
deliver	1
them	1
Alma	1
204	1
4	1
Now	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
unto	1
Ammon	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
Antiomno	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
unto	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
flatter	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cast	1
thy	1
brethren	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
Now	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Who	1
told	1
thee	1
that	1
thy	1
brethren	1
were	1
in	1
prison	1
Alma	1
205	1
5	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
No	1
one	1
hath	1
told	1
me	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
meGo	1
and	1
deliver	1
thy	1
brethren	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
prison	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
Alma	1
206	1
6	1
Now	1
when	1
Lamoni	1
had	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
should	1
make	1
ready	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
chariots	1
Alma	1
207	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Ammon	1
Come	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
cast	1
thy	1
brethren	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
Alma	1
208	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Lamoni	1
were	1
journeying	1
thither	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
who	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
209	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Why	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast	1
on	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Alma	1
2010	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
said	1
Whither	1
art	1
thou	1
going	1
with	1
this	1
Nephite	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
liar	1
Alma	1
2011	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lamoni	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
him	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
offend	1
him	1
Alma	1
2012	1
12	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
tarrying	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
kingdom	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
feast	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
Alma	1
2013	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Lamoni	1
had	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
behold	1
to	1
his	1
astonishment	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
Lamoni	1
thou	1
art	1
going	1
to	1
deliver	1
these	1
Nephites	1
who	1
are	1
sons	1
of	1
a	1
liar	1
Behold	1
he	1
robbed	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
children	1
are	1
also	1
come	1
amongst	1
us	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
by	1
their	1
cunning	1
and	1
their	1
lyings	1
deceive	1
us	1
that	1
they	1
again	1
may	1
rob	1
us	1
of	1
our	1
property	1
Alma	1
2014	1
14	1
Now	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
slay	1
Ammon	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Alma	1
2015	1
15	1
But	1
Lamoni	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
slay	1
Ammon	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
but	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
release	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ammon	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
men	1
and	1
holy	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
God	1
Alma	1
2016	1
16	1
Now	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
smite	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
2017	1
17	1
But	1
Ammon	1
stood	1
forth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
slay	1
thy	1
son	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
fall	1
than	1
thee	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
has	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
fall	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
thine	1
anger	1
thy	1
soul	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
saved	1
Alma	1
2018	1
18	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
forbear	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
slay	1
thy	1
son	1
he	1
being	1
an	1
innocent	1
man	1
his	1
blood	1
would	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
his	1
God	1
for	1
vengeance	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
and	1
perhaps	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
lose	1
thy	1
soul	1
Alma	1
2019	1
19	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
saying	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
slay	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
thou	1
that	1
hast	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
Alma	1
2020	1
20	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
slay	1
Ammon	1
But	1
Ammon	1
withstood	1
his	1
blows	1
and	1
also	1
smote	1
his	1
arm	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
use	1
it	1
Alma	1
2021	1
21	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
that	1
Ammon	1
could	1
slay	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
plead	1
with	1
Ammon	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
spare	1
his	1
life	1
Alma	1
2022	1
22	1
But	1
Ammon	1
raised	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thee	1
except	1
thou	1
wilt	1
grant	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
brethren	1
may	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
Alma	1
2023	1
23	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
fearing	1
he	1
should	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
said	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
spare	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
unto	1
thee	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ask	1
even	1
to	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Alma	1
2024	1
24	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
king	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desire	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
grant	1
that	1
my	1
brethren	1
may	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Lamoni	1
may	1
retain	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
grant	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
desires	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
he	1
thinketh	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
spare	1
thee	1
otherwise	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
2025	1
25	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
king	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
Alma	1
2026	1
26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
Ammon	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
love	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
Lamoni	1
he	1
was	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
said	1
Because	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
desired	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
release	1
thy	1
brethren	1
and	1
suffer	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
Lamoni	1
should	1
retain	1
his	1
kingdom	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
may	1
retain	1
his	1
kingdom	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
govern	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
Alma	1
2027	1

And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
grant	1
unto	1
thee	1
that	1
thy	1
brethren	1
may	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
and	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
greatly	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
thee	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
his	1
son	1
Lamoni	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
learn	1
them	1
Alma	1
2028	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Lamoni	1
proceeded	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
And	1
Lamoni	1
found	1
favor	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
therefore	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
Alma	1
2029	1
29	1
And	1
when	1
Ammon	1
did	1
meet	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
naked	1
and	1
their	1
skins	1
were	1
worn	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
being	1
bound	1
with	1
strong	1
cords	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
had	1
suffered	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
afflictions	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
patient	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sufferings	1
Alma	1
2030	1
30	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
happened	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
lot	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
hardened	1
and	1
a	1
more	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
and	1
had	1
smitten	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
driven	1
them	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
and	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
bound	1
with	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
kept	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
and	1
were	1
delivered	1
by	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
Ammon	1
Alma	1

Chapter	1
21	1
Alma	1
211	1
1	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
separated	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
behold	1
Aaron	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Jerusalem	1
calling	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
nativity	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
away	1
joining	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Mormon	1
Alma	1
212	1
2	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Amulon	1
had	1
built	1
a	1
great	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Jerusalem	1
Alma	1
213	1
3	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
of	1
themselves	1
were	1
sufficiently	1
hardened	1
but	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Amulonites	1
were	1
still	1
harder	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
Alma	1
214	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Aaron	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
to	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
built	1
synagogues	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Nehors	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Amulonites	1
were	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Nehors	1
Alma	1
215	1
5	1
Therefore	1
as	1
Aaron	1
entered	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
synagogues	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
unto	1
them	1
behold	1
there	1
arose	1
an	1
Amalekite	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
saying	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
testified	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
Why	1
do	1
not	1
angels	1
appear	1
unto	1
us	1
Behold	1
are	1
not	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
thy	1
people	1
Alma	1
216	1
6	1
Thou	1
also	1
sayest	1
except	1
we	1
repent	1
we	1
shall	1
perish	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
the	1
thought	1
and	1
intent	1
of	1
our	1
hearts	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
repent	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
Behold	1
we	1
have	1
built	1
sanctuaries	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
assemble	1
ourselves	1
together	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
We	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
save	1
all	1
men	1
Alma	1
217	1
7	1
Now	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
mankind	1
from	1
their	1
sins	1
Alma	1
218	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
these	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
neither	1
do	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thy	1
fathers	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
our	1
fathers	1
did	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
spake	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
219	1
9	1
Now	1
Aaron	1
began	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
scriptures	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
redemption	1
for	1
mankind	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
through	1
the	1
death	1
and	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
his	1
blood	1
Alma	1
2110	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
mock	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
Alma	1
2111	1
11	1
Therefore	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
synagogue	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
village	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
AniAnti	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
Muloki	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
Ammah	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
And	1
they	1
contended	1
with	1
many	1
about	1
the	1
word	1
Alma	1
2112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
therefore	1
they	1
departed	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
many	1
and	1
few	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
they	1
taught	1
Alma	1
2113	1
13	1
Nevertheless	1
Aaron	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
unto	1
the	1
regions	1
round	1
about	1
Alma	1
2114	1
14	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
Ammon	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
fed	1
and	1
clothed	1
Alma	1
2115	1
15	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
again	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
delivered	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
had	1
suffered	1
Alma	1
2116	1
16	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
or	1
in	1
every	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
admitted	1
Alma	1
2117	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
began	1
to	1
bless	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
convince	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
correct	1
Alma	1
2118	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Lamoni	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
Alma	1
2119	1
19	1
And	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
Ammon	1
should	1
serve	1
him	1
or	1
be	1
his	1
servant	1
Alma	1
2120	1
20	1
But	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
synagogues	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
his	1
reign	1
should	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
Alma	1
2121	1
21	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
also	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
free	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
oppressions	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
father	1
for	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
Alma	1
2122	1
22	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
worshiping	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
place	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
Alma	1
2123	1
23	1
And	1
Ammon	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
king	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
them	1
all	1
things	1
concerning	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
daily	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
zealous	1
for	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
22	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Alma	1
221	1
1	1
Now	1
as	1
Ammon	1
was	1
thus	1
teaching	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
continually	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
for	1
after	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
he	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
Alma	1
222	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
kings	1
palace	1
with	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
O	1
king	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ammon	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
prison	1
Alma	1
223	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
king	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
spare	1
our	1
lives	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servants	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Arise	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
your	1
lives	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servants	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
insist	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
administer	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
somewhat	1
troubled	1
in	1
mind	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
generosity	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
Ammon	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
why	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Middoni	1
with	1
thee	1
Alma	1
224	1
4	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
called	1
him	1
another	1
way	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lamoni	1
Alma	1
225	1
5	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
concerning	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1

And	1
also	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
Ammon	1
saidIf	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1

ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
227	1

And	1
Aaron	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
build	1
sanctuaries	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
worship	1
him	1
And	1
if	1
now	1
thou	1
sayest	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
believe	1
Alma	1
228	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Aaron	1
heard	1
this	1
his	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
Behold	1
assuredly	1
as	1
thou	1
livest	1
O	1
king	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
Alma	1
229	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
Is	1
God	1
that	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
that	1
brought	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
Alma	1
2210	1
10	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
he	1
is	1
that	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
and	1
he	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
both	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this	1
Alma	1
2211	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
Great	1
Spirit	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
tell	1
me	1
concerning	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
believe	1
thy	1
words	1
Alma	1
2212	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Aaron	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
would	1
believe	1
his	1
words	1
he	1
began	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
Adam	1
reading	1
the	1
scriptures	1
unto	1
the	1
kinghow	1
God	1
created	1
man	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
image	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
him	1
commandments	1
and	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
transgression	1
man	1
had	1
fallen	1
Alma	1
2213	1
13	1
And	1
Aaron	1
did	1
expound	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
scriptures	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
Adam	1
laying	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
man	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
their	1
carnal	1
state	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
Christ	1
for	1
all	1
whosoever	1
would	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
2214	1
14	1
And	1
since	1
man	1
had	1
fallen	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
merit	1
anything	1
of	1
himself	1
but	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
of	1
Christ	1
atone	1
for	1
their	1
sins	1
through	1
faith	1
and	1
repentance	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
breaketh	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
the	1
grave	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
victory	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
expound	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
2215	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Aaron	1
had	1
expounded	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
this	1
eternal	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
Yea	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
having	1
this	1
wicked	1
spirit	1
rooted	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
breast	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
Spirit	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Behold	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
possess	1
yea	1
I	1
will	1
forsake	1
my	1
kingdom	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
receive	1
this	1
great	1
joy	1
Alma	1
2216	1
16	1
But	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
If	1
thou	1
desirest	1
this	1
thing	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
God	1
yea	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
sins	1
and	1
will	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
faith	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
receive	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
thou	1
desirest	1
Alma	1
2217	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Aaron	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
yea	1
even	1
he	1
did	1
prostrate	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
cried	1
mightily	1
saying	1
Alma	1
2218	1
18	1
O	1
God	1
Aaron	1
hath	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
God	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
thyself	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
away	1
all	1
my	1
sins	1
to	1
know	1
thee	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead	1
Alma	1
2219	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
queen	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
lay	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
also	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
standing	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
fall	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
her	1
servants	1
or	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
take	1
them	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
2220	1
20	1
Now	1
the	1
servants	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
fall	1
therefore	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
pled	1
with	1
the	1
queen	1
saying	1
Why	1
commandest	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
slay	1
these	1
men	1
when	1
behold	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
us	1
all	1
Therefore	1
we	1
shall	1
fall	1
before	1
them	1
Alma	1
2221	1
21	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
saw	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
she	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
exceedingly	1
lest	1
there	1
should	1
some	1
evil	1
come	1
upon	1
her	1
And	1
she	1
commanded	1
her	1
servants	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
call	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
slay	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2222	1
22	1
Now	1
when	1
Aaron	1
saw	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
he	1
also	1
knowing	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
feared	1
lest	1
that	1
a	1
multitude	1
should	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
contention	1
and	1
a	1
disturbance	1
among	1
them	1
therefore	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
raised	1
the	1
king	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Stand	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
receiving	1
his	1
strength	1
Alma	1
2223	1
23	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it	1
they	1
greatly	1
marveled	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
household	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
2224	1
24	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
multitude	1
gathered	1
together	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
murmurings	1
among	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2225	1
25	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
administered	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
pacified	1
towards	1
Aaron	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
Alma	1
2226	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
pacified	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
should	1
stand	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
2227	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
amongst	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
land	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
regions	1
round	1
about	1
which	1
was	1
bordering	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
divided	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
by	1
a	1
narrow	1
strip	1
of	1
wilderness	1
which	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
east	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
west	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
by	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
through	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Manti	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
running	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
towards	1
the	1
westand	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
divided	1
Alma	1
2228	1
28	1
Now	1
the	1
more	1
idle	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
first	1
inheritance	1
and	1
thus	1
bordering	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
2229	1
29	1
And	1
also	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
Lamanites	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
whither	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
driven	1
them	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
nearly	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
northern	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
bordering	1
on	1
the	1
wilderness	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
wilderness	1
side	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
Bountiful	1
Alma	1
2230	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
bordered	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
Desolation	1
it	1
being	1
so	1
far	1
northward	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
peopled	1
and	1
been	1
destroyed	1
of	1
whose	1
bones	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
which	1
was	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
it	1
being	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
landing	1
Alma	1
2231	1
31	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
from	1
there	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
south	1
wilderness	1
Thus	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
northward	1
was	1
called	1
Desolation	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
southward	1
was	1
called	1
Bountiful	1
it	1
being	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wild	1
animals	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
for	1
food	1
Alma	1
2232	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
a	1
halfs	1
journey	1
for	1
a	1
Nephite	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
were	1
nearly	1
surrounded	1
by	1
water	1
there	1
being	1
a	1
small	1
neck	1
of	1
land	1
between	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
Alma	1
2233	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
inhabited	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
unto	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
their	1
wisdom	1
with	1
their	1
guards	1
and	1
their	1
armies	1
had	1
hemmed	1
in	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
possession	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
overrun	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
2234	1
34	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
possessions	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
the	1
wilderness	1
round	1
about	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
Nephitesas	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
their	1
afflictions	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
country	1
whither	1
they	1
might	1
flee	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1

And	1
now	1
I	1
after	1
having	1
said	1
this	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1

and	1
Himni	1
and	1
their	1

231	1
1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
Ammon	1
or	1
Aaron	1
or	1
Omner	1
or	1
Himni	1
nor	1
either	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
place	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
232	1
2	1
Yea	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
decree	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them	1
to	1
bind	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
them	1
nor	1
smite	1
them	1
nor	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
synagogues	1
nor	1
scourge	1
them	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
them	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
free	1
access	1
to	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
temples	1
and	1
their	1
sanctuaries	1
Alma	1
233	1
3	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
been	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
therefore	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
have	1
no	1
obstruction	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
go	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
convinced	1
concerning	1
the	1
wicked	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
brethren	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
murder	1
nor	1
to	1
plunder	1
nor	1
to	1
steal	1
nor	1
to	1
commit	1
adultery	1
nor	1
to	1
commit	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
Alma	1
234	1

And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
sent	1
forth	1
this	1
proclamation	1
that	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
forth	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
house	1
of	1
worship	1
to	1
another	1
establishing	1
churches	1
and	1
consecrating	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
preach	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
great	1
success	1
Alma	1
235	1
5	1
And	1
thousands	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
thousands	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
prophecies	1
which	1
were	1
handed	1
down	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
Alma	1
236	1

And	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
so	1
sure	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
believed	1
or	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
through	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
working	1
miracles	1
in	1
themyea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
as	1
believed	1
in	1
their	1
preaching	1
and	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
never	1
did	1
fall	1
away	1
Alma	1
237	1
7	1
For	1
they	1
became	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
they	1
did	1
lay	1
down	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
their	1
rebellion	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
fight	1
against	1
God	1
any	1
more	1
neither	1
against	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
238	1
8	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
239	1
9	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Alma	1
2310	1
10	1
And	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Middoni	1
Alma	1
2311	1
11	1
And	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
2312	1
12	1
And	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shilom	1
and	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shemlon	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Shimnilom	1
Alma	1
2313	1
13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
which	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
their	1
rebellion	1
yea	1
all	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
2314	1
14	1
And	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
were	1
not	1
converted	1
save	1
only	1
one	1
neither	1
were	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
Amulonites	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
wheresoever	1
they	1
dwelt	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
villages	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
cities	1
Alma	1
2315	1
15	1
Therefore	1
we	1
have	1
named	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
were	1
converted	1
Alma	1
2316	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
converted	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
distinguished	1
from	1
their	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
the	1
king	1
consulted	1
with	1
Aaron	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
priests	1
concerning	1
the	1
name	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
distinguished	1
Alma	1
2317	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
called	1
their	1
names	1
AntiNephiLehies	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
this	1
name	1
and	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
called	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
2318	1
18	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
industrious	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
friendly	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
open	1
a	1
correspondence	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
follow	1
them	1
Alma	1
24	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Alma	1
241	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Amulonites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Amulon	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Helam	1
and	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
converted	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
were	1
stirred	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Amulonites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
242	1
2	1
And	1
their	1
hatred	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
against	1
them	1
even	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
rebel	1
against	1
their	1
king	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
Alma	1
243	1
3	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
conferred	1
the	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
Alma	1
244	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
died	1
in	1
that	1
selfsame	1
year	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
245	1
5	1
Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
saw	1
the	1
preparations	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
destroy	1
their	1
brethren	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian	1
and	1
there	1
Ammon	1
met	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
hold	1
a	1
council	1
with	1
Lamoni	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
246	1
6	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
soul	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
would	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
nay	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
make	1
any	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
king	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
Alma	1
247	1
7	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
my	1
beloved	1
people	1
that	1
our	1
great	1
God	1
has	1
in	1
goodness	1
sent	1
these	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
our	1
wicked	1
fathers	1
Alma	1
248	1
8	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
great	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit	1
to	1
soften	1
our	1
hearts	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
opened	1
a	1
correspondence	1
with	1
these	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
249	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
also	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
that	1
by	1
opening	1
this	1
correspondence	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
convinced	1
of	1
our	1
sins	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
murders	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
Alma	1
2410	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
yea	1
my	1
great	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
granted	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
repent	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
forgiven	1
us	1
of	1
those	1
our	1
many	1
sins	1
and	1
murders	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
and	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
guilt	1
from	1
our	1
hearts	1
through	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Alma	1
2411	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
do	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
lost	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
murders	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
God	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
our	1
hearts	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
we	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
repent	1
sufficiently	1
before	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
stain	1
Alma	1
2412	1
12	1
Now	1
my	1
best	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
since	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
our	1
stains	1
and	1
our	1
swords	1
have	1
become	1
bright	1
then	1
let	1
us	1
stain	1
our	1
swords	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2413	1
13	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
let	1
us	1
retain	1
our	1
swords	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
stained	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
for	1
perhaps	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
stain	1
our	1
swords	1
again	1
they	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
washed	1
bright	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
our	1
great	1
God	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
shed	1
for	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
our	1
sins	1
Alma	1
2414	1
14	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
has	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
made	1
these	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
perish	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
these	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
beforehand	1
because	1
he	1
loveth	1
our	1
souls	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
loveth	1
our	1
children	1
therefore	1
in	1
his	1
mercy	1
he	1
doth	1
visit	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
angels	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
salvation	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
future	1
generations	1
Alma	1
2415	1

Oh	1
how	1
merciful	1
is	1
our	1
God	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
stains	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
swords	1
are	1
made	1
bright	1
let	1
us	1
hide	1
them	1
away	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
kept	1
bright	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
stained	1
our	1
swords	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
since	1
he	1
imparted	1
his	1
word	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
has	1
made	1
us	1
clean	1
thereby	1
Alma	1
2416	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
if	1
our	1
brethren	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
us	1
behold	1
we	1
will	1
hide	1
away	1
our	1
swords	1
yea	1
even	1
we	1
will	1
bury	1
them	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
kept	1
bright	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
used	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
and	1
if	1
our	1
brethren	1
destroy	1
us	1
behold	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
Alma	1
2417	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
sayings	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
assembled	1
together	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
weapons	1
which	1
were	1
used	1
for	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
mans	1
blood	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
bury	1
them	1
up	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
2418	1
18	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
it	1
being	1
in	1
their	1
view	1
a	1
testimony	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
would	1
use	1
weapons	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
mans	1
blood	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
vouching	1
and	1
covenanting	1
with	1
God	1
that	1
rather	1
than	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
their	1
own	1
lives	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
brother	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
spend	1
their	1
days	1
in	1
idleness	1
they	1
would	1
labor	1
abundantly	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
Alma	1
2419	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
when	1
these	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
they	1
were	1
firm	1
and	1
would	1
suffer	1
even	1
unto	1
death	1
rather	1
than	1
commit	1
sin	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
buried	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
peace	1
or	1
they	1
buried	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
for	1
peace	1
Alma	1
2420	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
made	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
and	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
destroying	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
to	1
place	1
another	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
destroying	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
2421	1
21	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
coming	1
against	1
them	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
and	1
prostrated	1
themselves	1
before	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
this	1
attitude	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
2422	1
22	1
And	1
thus	1
without	1
meeting	1
any	1
resistance	1
they	1
did	1
slay	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
blessed	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
2423	1
23	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
brethren	1
would	1
not	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
sword	1
neither	1
would	1
they	1
turn	1
aside	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
perish	1
and	1
praised	1
God	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
perishing	1
under	1
the	1
sword	1
Alma	1
2424	1
24	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
forbear	1
from	1
slaying	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
whose	1
hearts	1
had	1
swollen	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
under	1
the	1
sword	1
for	1
they	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
Alma	1
2425	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
them	1
again	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
stung	1
for	1
the	1
murders	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
committed	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
even	1
as	1
their	1
brethren	1
relying	1
upon	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
arms	1
were	1
lifted	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
2426	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
were	1
joined	1
that	1
day	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
number	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
were	1
righteous	1
people	1
therefore	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saved	1
Alma	1
2427	1
27	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
wicked	1
man	1
slain	1
among	1
them	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
worketh	1
in	1
many	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
2428	1
28	1
Now	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
slew	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
were	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
Amulonites	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Nehors	1
Alma	1
2429	1
29	1
Now	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
joined	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
who	1
were	1
Amalekites	1
or	1
Amulonites	1
or	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Nehor	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
actual	1
descendants	1
of	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
Alma	1
2430	1
30	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
can	1
plainly	1
discern	1
that	1
after	1
a	1
people	1
have	1
been	1
once	1
enlightened	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
have	1
had	1
great	1
knowledge	1
of	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
and	1
then	1
have	1
fallen	1
away	1
into	1
sin	1
and	1
transgression	1
they	1
become	1
more	1
hardened	1
and	1
thus	1
their	1
state	1
becomes	1
worse	1
than	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
25	1
Chapter	1
25	1
Alma	1
251	1
1	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
more	1
angry	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
their	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
they	1
swore	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
attempt	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
Alma	1
252	1
2	1
But	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
armies	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
Alma	1
253	1
3	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
many	1
battles	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
and	1
slain	1
Alma	1
254	1
4	1
And	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
were	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Amulon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Noah	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
255	1
5	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
having	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
and	1
having	1
usurped	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
caused	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
perish	1
by	1
fire	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
belief	1
Alma	1
256	1
6	1
For	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
after	1
having	1
suffered	1
much	1
loss	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
afflictions	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
had	1
preached	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
land	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
great	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
thus	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
converted	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
257	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
rulers	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Amulon	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
yea	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
believed	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
258	1
8	1
Now	1
this	1
martyrdom	1
caused	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
should	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
hunt	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Amulon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
259	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
hunted	1
at	1
this	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Thus	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
concerning	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
who	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
suffer	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
Alma	1
2510	1
10	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
What	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
2511	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
Abinadi	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
suffered	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
belief	1
in	1
God	1
now	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
that	1
many	1
should	1
suffer	1
death	1
by	1
fire	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
Alma	1
2512	1
12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Noah	1
that	1
their	1
seed	1
should	1
cause	1
many	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
and	1
slain	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
having	1
no	1
shepherd	1
is	1
driven	1
and	1
slain	1
by	1
wild	1
beasts	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
verified	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
hunted	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
Alma	1
2513	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
overpower	1
the	1
Nephites	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
land	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
did	1
join	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
Alma	1
2514	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
bury	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
according	1
as	1
their	1
brethren	1
had	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
Alma	1
2515	1
15	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
as	1
yet	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
fulfilled	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
they	1
did	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
was	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
believing	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
keep	1
those	1
outward	1
performances	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
revealed	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
2516	1
16	1
Now	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
salvation	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
but	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
did	1
serve	1
to	1
strengthen	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
retain	1
a	1
hope	1
through	1
faith	1
unto	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
relying	1
upon	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
which	1
spake	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
2517	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Omner	1
and	1
Himni	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
did	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
the	1
success	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
prayers	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
verified	1
his	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1

Alma	1
261	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ammon	1
to	1
his	1
brethren	1
which	1
say	1
thus	1
My	1
brothers	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
how	1
great	1
reason	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
rejoice	1
for	1
could	1
we	1
have	1
supposed	1
when	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
have	1
granted	1
unto	1
us	1
such	1
great	1
blessings	1
Alma	1
262	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
what	1
great	1
blessings	1
has	1
he	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
Can	1
ye	1
tell	1
Alma	1
263	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
answer	1
for	1
you	1
for	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
in	1
darkness	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
darkest	1
abyss	1
but	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
marvelous	1
light	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
blessing	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
instruments	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
this	1
great	1
work	1
Alma	1
264	1
4	1
Behold	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
do	1
rejoice	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
fold	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
265	1
5	1
Behold	1
the	1
field	1
was	1
ripe	1
and	1
blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
for	1
ye	1
did	1
thrust	1
in	1
the	1
sickle	1
and	1
did	1
reap	1
with	1
your	1
might	1
yea	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
did	1
ye	1
labor	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
sheaves	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
into	1
the	1
garners	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
wasted	1
Alma	1

Yea	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
beaten	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
storm	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
yea	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
harrowed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
whirlwinds	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
storm	1
cometh	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
their	1
place	1
that	1
the	1
storm	1
cannot	1
penetrate	1
to	1
them	1

But	1

they	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
his	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
raise	1
them	1
up	1
at	1
the	1

day	1
Alma	1
268	1

Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
let	1
us	1
sing	1
to	1
his	1
praise	1
yea	1
let	1
us	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
holy	1
name	1
for	1
he	1
doth	1
work	1
righteousness	1
forever	1
Alma	1
269	1

For	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
these	1
our	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
us	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
racked	1
with	1
hatred	1
against	1
us	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
strangers	1
to	1
God	1
Alma	1
2610	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
his	1
brother	1
Aaron	1
rebuked	1
him	1
saying	1
Ammon	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
thy	1
joy	1
doth	1
carry	1
thee	1
away	1
unto	1
boasting	1
Alma	1
2611	1
11	1
But	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
boast	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
strength	1
nor	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
wisdom	1
but	1
behold	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
full	1
yea	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
brim	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
God	1
Alma	1
2612	1
12	1
Yea	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
nothing	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
strength	1
I	1
am	1
weak	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
myself	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
boast	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
strength	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
yea	1
behold	1
many	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
we	1
have	1
wrought	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
for	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
praise	1
his	1
name	1
forever	1
Alma	1
2613	1
13	1
Behold	1
how	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
has	1
he	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
sing	1
redeeming	1
love	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
us	1
therefore	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
great	1
reason	1
to	1
rejoice	1
Alma	1
2614	1
14	1
Yea	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
praise	1
him	1
forever	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
God	1
and	1
has	1
loosed	1
our	1
brethren	1
from	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
hell	1
Alma	1
2615	1
15	1
Yea	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
with	1
everlasting	1
darkness	1
and	1
destruction	1
but	1
behold	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
everlasting	1
light	1
yea	1
into	1
everlasting	1
salvation	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
encircled	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
matchless	1
bounty	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
instruments	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
of	1
doing	1
this	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
work	1
Alma	1
2616	1
16	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
glory	1
yea	1
we	1
will	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
we	1
will	1
rejoice	1
for	1
our	1
joy	1
is	1
full	1
yea	1
we	1
will	1
praise	1
our	1
God	1
forever	1
Behold	1
who	1
can	1
glory	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Yea	1
who	1
can	1
say	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
longsuffering	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
the	1
smallest	1
part	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
Alma	1
2617	1
17	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
supposed	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
merciful	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
snatched	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
awful	1
sinful	1
and	1
polluted	1
state	1
Alma	1
2618	1
18	1
Behold	1
we	1
went	1
forth	1
even	1
in	1
wrath	1
with	1
mighty	1
threatenings	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
church	1
Alma	1
2619	1
19	1
Oh	1
then	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
consign	1
us	1
to	1
an	1
awful	1
destruction	1
yea	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
justice	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
doom	1
us	1
to	1
eternal	1
despair	1
Alma	1
2620	1
20	1
Oh	1
my	1
soul	1
almost	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fleeth	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
Behold	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
exercise	1
his	1
justice	1
upon	1
us	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
mercy	1
hath	1
brought	1
us	1
over	1
that	1
everlasting	1
gulf	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
misery	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
souls	1
Alma	1
2621	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
what	1
natural	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
knoweth	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
knoweth	1
these	1
things	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
penitent	1
Alma	1
2622	1
22	1
Yea	1
he	1
that	1
repenteth	1
and	1
exerciseth	1
faith	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
works	1
and	1
prayeth	1
continually	1
without	1
ceasingunto	1
such	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
unto	1
such	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
reveal	1
things	1
which	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
revealed	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
such	1
to	1
bring	1
thousands	1
of	1
souls	1
to	1
repentance	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
bring	1
these	1
our	1
brethren	1
to	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
2623	1
23	1
Now	1
do	1
ye	1
remember	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
laughed	1
us	1
to	1
scorn	1
Alma	1
2624	1
24	1
For	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
us	1
Do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
bring	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
Do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
convince	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
of	1
the	1
incorrectness	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
as	1
stiffnecked	1
a	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
whose	1
hearts	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
whose	1
days	1
have	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
grossest	1
iniquity	1
whose	1
ways	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
a	1
transgressor	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Now	1
my	1
brethren	1
ye	1
remember	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
their	1
language	1
Alma	1
2625	1
25	1
And	1
moreover	1
they	1
did	1
say	1
Let	1
us	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
we	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
iniquity	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
lest	1
they	1
overrun	1
us	1
and	1
destroy	1
us	1
Alma	1
2626	1
26	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
we	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
intent	1
to	1
destroy	1
our	1
brethren	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
save	1
some	1
few	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
Alma	1
2627	1
27	1
Now	1
when	1
our	1
hearts	1
were	1
depressed	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
comforted	1
us	1
and	1
said	1
Go	1
amongst	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
bear	1
with	1
patience	1
thine	1
afflictions	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
success	1
Alma	1
2628	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
and	1
been	1
forth	1
amongst	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
patient	1
in	1
our	1
sufferings	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
every	1
privation	1
yea	1
we	1
have	1
traveled	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
relying	1
upon	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
worldnot	1
upon	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
alone	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
2629	1
29	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
streets	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
taught	1
them	1
upon	1
their	1
hills	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
also	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
temples	1
and	1
their	1
synagogues	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
mocked	1
and	1
spit	1
upon	1
and	1
smote	1
upon	1
our	1
cheeks	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
stoned	1
and	1
taken	1
and	1
bound	1
with	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
delivered	1
again	1
Alma	1
2630	1
30	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
saving	1
some	1
soul	1
and	1
we	1
supposed	1
that	1
our	1
joy	1
would	1
be	1
full	1
if	1
perhaps	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
saving	1
some	1
Alma	1
2631	1
31	1
Now	1
behold	1
we	1
can	1
look	1
forth	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
our	1
labors	1
and	1
are	1
they	1
few	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
they	1
are	1
many	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
witness	1
of	1
their	1
sincerity	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
towards	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
towards	1
us	1

For	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
rather	1
sacrifice	1
their	1
lives	1
than	1
even	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
their	1
enemy	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
buried	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
towards	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2633	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
so	1
great	1
love	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
there	1
has	1
not	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
2634	1
34	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
would	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
slain	1
But	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
have	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
their	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
hatred	1
to	1
sin	1
Alma	1
2635	1
35	1
Now	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
reason	1
to	1
rejoice	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
men	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
great	1
reason	1
to	1
rejoice	1
as	1
we	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
yea	1
and	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1
even	1
unto	1
boasting	1
in	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
all	1
power	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
all	1
understanding	1
he	1
comprehendeth	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
merciful	1
Being	1
even	1
unto	1
salvation	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Alma	1
2636	1
36	1
Now	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
boasting	1
even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
boast	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
light	1
my	1
joy	1
and	1
my	1
salvation	1
and	1
my	1
redemption	1
from	1
everlasting	1
wo	1
Yea	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
lost	1
from	1
its	1
body	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
who	1

of	1
us	1
wanderers	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1

2637	1

Now	1
my	1
brethren	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
mindful	1
of	1
every	1
people	1
whatsoever	1
land	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
in	1

his	1

Now	1
this	1
is	1
my	1

Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
those	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
found	1
after	1
their	1
many	1
struggles	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
seek	1
their	1
destruction	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
272	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
loss	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
seek	1
revenge	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
anger	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
Alma	1
273	1
3	1
Now	1
this	1
people	1
again	1
refused	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
they	1
suffered	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
slain	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1

Now	1
when	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
saw	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
among	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
so	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
and	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
dearly	1

themfor	1
they	1
were	1
treated	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
angels	1

from	1

to	1
save	1
them	1
from	1
everlasting	1

when	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
saw	1
this	1
great	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
275	1
5	1
Let	1
us	1
gather	1
together	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
that	1
we	1
be	1
not	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
276	1
6	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
will	1
destroy	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
murders	1
and	1
sins	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
277	1
7	1
And	1
Ammon	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
will	1
ye	1
go	1
Alma	1
278	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
saith	1
unto	1
us	1
go	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
slaves	1
until	1
we	1
repair	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
many	1
murders	1
and	1
sins	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
279	1
9	1
But	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
It	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
slaves	1
among	1
them	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
rely	1
upon	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2710	1
10	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
us	1
go	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
otherwise	1
we	1
will	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
2711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
went	1
and	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
2712	1
12	1
Get	1
this	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
perish	1
not	1
for	1
Satan	1
has	1
great	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
who	1
do	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
therefore	1
get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
blessed	1
are	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
generation	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
them	1
Alma	1
2713	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
2714	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
their	1
people	1
yea	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
all	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
divided	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
near	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
2715	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
will	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
remain	1
here	1
until	1
we	1
return	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
try	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
2716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
Ammon	1
was	1
going	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
met	1
Alma	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
and	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
joyful	1
meeting	1
Alma	1
2717	1
17	1
Now	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Ammon	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
yea	1
he	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
exhausting	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
2718	1
18	1
Now	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
exceeding	1
joy	1
Behold	1
this	1
is	1
joy	1
which	1
none	1
receiveth	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
truly	1
penitent	1
and	1
humble	1
seeker	1
of	1
happiness	1
Alma	1
2719	1
19	1
Now	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Alma	1
in	1
meeting	1
his	1
brethren	1
was	1
truly	1
great	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Aaron	1
of	1
Omner	1
and	1
Himni	1
but	1
behold	1
their	1
joy	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
to	1
exceed	1
their	1
strength	1
Alma	1
2720	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
conducted	1
his	1
brethren	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
among	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
2721	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
desiring	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
admitting	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
Alma	1
2722	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
saying	1
Behold	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
joins	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
this	1
land	1
Jershon	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
Alma	1
2723	1
23	1
And	1
behold	1
we	1
will	1
set	1
our	1
armies	1
between	1
the	1
land	1
Jershon	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
Nephi	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
protect	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Jershon	1
and	1
this	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
our	1
brethren	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
fear	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
commit	1
sin	1
and	1
this	1
their	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sore	1
repentance	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
many	1
murders	1
and	1
their	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
Alma	1
2724	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
Jershon	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
guard	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
enemies	1
with	1
our	1
armies	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
to	1
assist	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
maintain	1
our	1
armies	1
Alma	1
2725	1
25	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Ammon	1
had	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
and	1
also	1
Alma	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
And	1
Alma	1
also	1
related	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
conversion	1
with	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
2726	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
cause	1
great	1
joy	1
among	1
them	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
distinguished	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
ever	1
after	1
Alma	1
2727	1
27	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
also	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
distinguished	1
for	1
their	1
zeal	1
towards	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
towards	1
men	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
perfectly	1
honest	1
and	1
upright	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
Alma	1
2728	1
28	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
look	1
upon	1
shedding	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
abhorrence	1
and	1
they	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
never	1
did	1
look	1
upon	1
death	1
with	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
terror	1
for	1
their	1
hope	1
and	1
views	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
therefore	1
death	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
victory	1
of	1
Christ	1
over	1
it	1
Alma	1
2729	1

Therefore	1
they	1
would	1
suffer	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
aggravating	1
and	1
distressing	1
manner	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
inflicted	1
by	1
their	1
brethren	1
before	1
they	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
or	1
cimeter	1
to	1
smite	1
them	1
Alma	1
2730	1

And	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
zealous	1
and	1
beloved	1
people	1
a	1
highly	1
favored	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
281	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
a	1
church	1
also	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
set	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
yea	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
borders	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
behold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
followed	1
their	1
brethren	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
282	1
2	1
And	1
thus	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tremendous	1
battle	1
yea	1
even	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
yea	1
and	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
Alma	1
283	1
3	1
Yea	1
and	1
also	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tremendous	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
driven	1
and	1
scattered	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
284	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
mourning	1
and	1
lamentation	1
heard	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
285	1
5	1
Yea	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
widows	1
mourning	1
for	1
their	1
husbands	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
fathers	1
mourning	1
for	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
for	1
the	1
brother	1
yea	1
the	1
brother	1
for	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
mourning	1
was	1
heard	1
among	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
mourning	1
for	1
their	1
kindred	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1

And	1
now	1
surely	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
day	1
yea	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
solemnity	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
much	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer	1
Alma	1
287	1

And	1
thus	1
endeth	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
288	1
8	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
their	1
journeyings	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
their	1
sufferings	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
their	1
sorrows	1
and	1
their	1
afflictions	1
and	1
their	1
incomprehensible	1
joy	1
and	1
the	1
reception	1
and	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
And	1
now	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
bless	1
their	1
souls	1
forever	1

And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
fifteenth	1

of	1
the	1

of	1

And	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
to	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
has	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
many	1
thousand	1
lives	1
yea	1
it	1
has	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
an	1
awful	1
scene	1
of	1
bloodshed	1
Alma	1
2811	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
many	1
thousands	1
are	1
laid	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
while	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
many	1
thousands	1
are	1
moldering	1
in	1
heaps	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
and	1
many	1
thousands	1
are	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
kindred	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
consigned	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
endless	1
wo	1
Alma	1
2812	1
12	1
While	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
others	1
truly	1
mourn	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
kindred	1
yet	1
they	1
rejoice	1
and	1
exult	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
and	1
even	1
know	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
raised	1
to	1
dwell	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
neverending	1
happiness	1
Alma	1
2813	1
13	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
how	1
great	1
the	1
inequality	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
transgression	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
which	1
comes	1
by	1
the	1
cunning	1
plans	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
devised	1
to	1
ensnare	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
2814	1
14	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
call	1
of	1
diligence	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
labor	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
reason	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
rejoicingsorrow	1
because	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
destruction	1
among	1

O	1

could	1
have	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
mine	1

that	1
I	1
might	1
go	1
forth	1

speak	1
with	1
the	1

with	1
a	1

shake	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
cry	1

unto	1
every	1

Yea	1
I	1
would	1
declare	1
unto	1
every	1

the	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder	1
repentance	1
and	1
the	1

that	1

upon	1
all	1
the	1

But	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
do	1
sin	1
in	1
my	1
wish	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1

which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
allotted	1
unto	1
me	1

294	1

I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1

up	1
in	1
my	1

the	1
firm	1
decree	1
of	1
a	1

to	1
their	1

whether	1
it	1

unto	1

Yea	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
good	1

have	1
come	1
before	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1

Now	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
these	1

why	1
should	1
I	1

which	1
I	1
have	1

Why	1
should	1

that	1
I	1

For	1
behold	1
the	1

doth	1
grant	1
unto	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
their	1

nation	1

tongue	1
to	1

in	1
wisdom	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
seeth	1
fit	1
that	1

therefore	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1

counsel	1
in	1

according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1

and	1
this	1

I	1
may	1
be	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
God	1
to	1
bring	1

this	1

my	1
joy	1

And	1
behold	1

coming	1

Yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
remember	1
the	1
captivity	1

do	1
know	1

I	1
do	1
not	1
joy	1
in	1
my	1

my	1
joy	1
is	1
more	1
full	1

of	1
the	1
success	1

shall	1
be	1
their	1
reward	1

Now	1
when	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
these	1
my	1

my	1
soul	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1

to	1
the	1
separation	1

it	1
from	1
the	1

it	1

my	1
joy	1

And	1
now	1
may	1

may	1
sit	1
down	1

and	1
also	1
all	1
those	1

are	1
the	1

year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
continual	1
peace	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
303	1
3	1
Yea	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
strict	1
in	1
observing	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
until	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Alma	1
304	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
have	1
no	1
disturbance	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
305	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
Alma	1
306	1
6	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
AntiChrist	1
for	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
307	1
7	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1
against	1
a	1
mans	1
belief	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
strictly	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
law	1
which	1
should	1
bring	1
men	1
on	1
to	1
unequal	1
grounds	1
Alma	1
308	1
8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture	1
Choose	1
ye	1
this	1
day	1
whom	1
ye	1
will	1
serve	1
Alma	1
309	1
9	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
desired	1
to	1
serve	1
God	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
privilege	1
or	1
rather	1
if	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
God	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
privilege	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
Alma	1
3010	1
10	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
murdered	1
he	1
was	1
punished	1
unto	1
death	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
robbed	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
punished	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
stole	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
punished	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
committed	1
adultery	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
punished	1
yea	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
wickedness	1
they	1
were	1
punished	1
Alma	1
3011	1
11	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
law	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
crimes	1
Nevertheless	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1
against	1
a	1
mans	1
belief	1
therefore	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
punished	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
crimes	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
therefore	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
on	1
equal	1
grounds	1
Alma	1
3012	1
12	1
And	1
this	1
AntiChrist	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Korihor	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
hold	1
upon	1
him	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
Christ	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
he	1
preach	1
saying	1
Alma	1
3013	1
13	1
O	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
bound	1
down	1
under	1
a	1
foolish	1
and	1
a	1
vain	1
hope	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
yoke	1
yourselves	1
with	1
such	1
foolish	1
things	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
Christ	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
know	1
of	1
anything	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
3014	1
14	1
Behold	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
call	1
prophecies	1
which	1
ye	1
say	1
are	1
handed	1
down	1
by	1
holy	1
prophets	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
Alma	1
3015	1
15	1
How	1
do	1
ye	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
Behold	1
ye	1
cannot	1
know	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
therefore	1
ye	1
cannot	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
3016	1
16	1
Ye	1
look	1
forward	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
frenzied	1
mind	1
and	1
this	1
derangement	1
of	1
your	1
minds	1
comes	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
which	1
lead	1
you	1
away	1
into	1
a	1
belief	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
Alma	1
3017	1
17	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
such	1
things	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
telling	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
atonement	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
fared	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
therefore	1
every	1
man	1
prospered	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
genius	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
conquered	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
a	1
man	1
did	1
was	1
no	1
crime	1
Alma	1
3018	1
18	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
causing	1
them	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
their	1
wickedness	1
yea	1
leading	1
away	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
also	1
men	1
to	1
commit	1
whoredomstelling	1
them	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
dead	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
Alma	1
3019	1
19	1
Now	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
also	1
to	1
preach	1
these	1
things	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
3020	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
wise	1
than	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
for	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
before	1
Ammon	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
that	1
people	1
Alma	1
3021	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
also	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
much	1
success	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
carried	1
before	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
3022	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
go	1
about	1
perverting	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
teach	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
Christ	1
to	1
interrupt	1
their	1
rejoicings	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
speak	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
Alma	1
3023	1
23	1
Now	1
the	1
high	1
priests	1
name	1
was	1
Giddonah	1
And	1
Korihor	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Because	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
teach	1
the	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
teach	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
bind	1
themselves	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
foolish	1
ordinances	1
and	1
performances	1
which	1
are	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
ancient	1
priests	1
to	1
usurp	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
ignorance	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
heads	1
but	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words	1
Alma	1
3024	1
24	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
a	1
free	1
people	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
bondage	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
ancient	1
prophecies	1
are	1
true	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
Alma	1
3025	1
25	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
a	1
guilty	1
and	1
a	1
fallen	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
a	1
parent	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
child	1
is	1
not	1
guilty	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
parents	1
Alma	1
3026	1
26	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
say	1
that	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Christ	1
And	1
ye	1
say	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
3027	1
27	1
And	1
thus	1
ye	1
lead	1
away	1
this	1
people	1
after	1
the	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
desires	1
and	1
ye	1
keep	1
them	1
down	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
glut	1
yourselves	1
with	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
look	1
up	1
with	1
boldness	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
enjoy	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
privileges	1
Alma	1
3028	1
28	1
Yea	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
their	1
own	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
offend	1
their	1
priests	1
who	1
do	1
yoke	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
believe	1
by	1
their	1
traditions	1
and	1
their	1
dreams	1
and	1
their	1
whims	1
and	1
their	1
visions	1
and	1
their	1
pretended	1
mysteries	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
words	1
offend	1
some	1
unknown	1
being	1
who	1
they	1
say	1
is	1
Goda	1
being	1
who	1
never	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
or	1
known	1
who	1
never	1
was	1
nor	1
ever	1
will	1
be	1
Alma	1
3029	1
29	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
saw	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
yea	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
revile	1
even	1
against	1
God	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
they	1
caused	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
bound	1
and	1
they	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
who	1
was	1
governor	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
3030	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
he	1
did	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
yea	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
blaspheme	1
Alma	1
3031	1
31	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
great	1
swelling	1
words	1
before	1
Alma	1
and	1
did	1
revile	1
against	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
accusing	1
them	1
of	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
people	1
after	1
the	1
silly	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
glutting	1
on	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
3032	1
32	1
Now	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
glut	1
ourselves	1
upon	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
labored	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
until	1
now	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
my	1
support	1
notwithstanding	1
my	1
many	1
travels	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Alma	1
3033	1
33	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
many	1
labors	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
received	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
even	1
one	1
senine	1
for	1
my	1
labor	1
neither	1
has	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
only	1
according	1
to	1
law	1
for	1
our	1
time	1
Alma	1
3034	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
receive	1
anything	1
for	1
our	1
labors	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
what	1
doth	1
it	1
profit	1
us	1
to	1
labor	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
rejoicings	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
3035	1
35	1
Then	1
why	1
sayest	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
preach	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
when	1
thou	1
of	1
thyself	1
knowest	1
that	1
we	1
receive	1
no	1
gain	1
And	1
now	1
believest	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
deceive	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
causes	1
such	1
joy	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
Alma	1
3036	1
36	1
And	1
Korihor	1
answered	1
him	1
Yea	1
Alma	1
3037	1
37	1
And	1
then	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
Alma	1
3038	1
38	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
Nay	1
Alma	1
3039	1
39	1
Now	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Will	1
ye	1
deny	1
again	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
deny	1
the	1
Christ	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
Alma	1
3040	1
40	1
And	1
now	1
what	1
evidence	1
have	1
ye	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
or	1
that	1
Christ	1
cometh	1
not	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
word	1
only	1
Alma	1
3041	1
41	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
will	1
ye	1
deny	1
them	1
Believest	1
thou	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
Alma	1
3042	1
42	1
Behold	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
believest	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
lying	1
spirit	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
carry	1
you	1
about	1
working	1
devices	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
destroy	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3043	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
Korihor	1
said	1
unto	1
Alma	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
show	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
yea	1
show	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
power	1
and	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
thy	1
words	1
Alma	1
3044	1
44	1
But	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Thou	1
hast	1
had	1
signs	1
enough	1
will	1
ye	1
tempt	1
your	1
God	1
Will	1
ye	1
say	1
Show	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
thy	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
The	1
scriptures	1
are	1
laid	1
before	1
thee	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
denote	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it	1
yea	1
and	1
its	1
motion	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
planets	1
which	1
move	1
in	1
their	1
regular	1
form	1
do	1
witness	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Supreme	1
Creator	1
Alma	1
3045	1
45	1
And	1
yet	1
do	1
ye	1
go	1
about	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
testifying	1
unto	1
them	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
And	1
yet	1
will	1
ye	1
deny	1
against	1
all	1
these	1
witnesses	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
deny	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
show	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
Alma	1
3046	1
46	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
yea	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
still	1
resist	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
may	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
3047	1
47	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
should	1
be	1
lost	1
than	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
many	1
souls	1
down	1
to	1
destruction	1
by	1
thy	1
lying	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
flattering	1
words	1
therefore	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
again	1
behold	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
become	1
dumb	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
open	1
thy	1
mouth	1
any	1
more	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
deceive	1
this	1
people	1
any	1
more	1
Alma	1
3048	1
48	1
Now	1
Korihor	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
God	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
show	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
Alma	1
3049	1
49	1
Now	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
This	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
struck	1
dumb	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
struck	1
dumb	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
utterance	1
Alma	1
3050	1
50	1
Now	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
Korihor	1
was	1
struck	1
dumb	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
utterance	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
3051	1
51	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
saw	1
this	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
wrote	1
unto	1
Korihor	1
saying	1
Art	1
thou	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
In	1
whom	1
did	1
ye	1
desire	1
that	1
Alma	1
should	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
sign	1
Would	1
ye	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
afflict	1
others	1
to	1
show	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
sign	1
Behold	1
he	1
has	1
showed	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
now	1
will	1
ye	1
dispute	1
more	1
Alma	1
3052	1
52	1
And	1
Korihor	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
wrote	1
saying	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
dumb	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
could	1
bring	1
this	1
upon	1
me	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
always	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
God	1
Alma	1
3053	1
53	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
devil	1
hath	1
deceived	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Go	1
and	1
reclaim	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
gone	1
astray	1
after	1
an	1
unknown	1
God	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
taught	1
me	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
taught	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
I	1
taught	1
them	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
and	1
I	1
taught	1
them	1
even	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
much	1
success	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
verily	1
believed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
true	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
withstood	1
the	1
truth	1
even	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
great	1
curse	1
upon	1
me	1
Alma	1
3054	1
54	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
besought	1
that	1
Alma	1
should	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
curse	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
him	1
Alma	1
3055	1
55	1
But	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
If	1
this	1
curse	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
thee	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
again	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
Alma	1
3056	1
56	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
curse	1
was	1
not	1
taken	1
off	1
of	1
Korihor	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
begging	1
for	1
his	1
food	1
Alma	1
3057	1
57	1
Now	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
Korihor	1
was	1
immediately	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
the	1
proclamation	1
was	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
declaring	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Korihor	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
speedily	1
repent	1
lest	1
the	1
same	1
judgments	1
would	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
3058	1
58	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Korihor	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
converted	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
this	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
iniquity	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Korihor	1
And	1
Korihor	1
did	1
go	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
begging	1
food	1
for	1
his	1
support	1
Alma	1
3059	1
59	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
yea	1
among	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
separated	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
called	1
themselves	1
Zoramites	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Zoramand	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
amongst	1
them	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
run	1
upon	1
and	1
trodden	1
down	1
even	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
Alma	1
3060	1
60	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
perverteth	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
will	1
not	1
support	1
his	1
children	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
but	1
doth	1
speedily	1
drag	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
Alma	1
31	1
Chapter	1
31	1
Alma	1
311	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
Korihor	1
Alma	1
having	1
received	1
tidings	1
that	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
were	1
perverting	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
that	1
Zoram	1
who	1
was	1
their	1
leader	1
was	1
leading	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
dumb	1
idols	1
his	1
heart	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
sicken	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
312	1
2	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
great	1
sorrow	1
to	1
Alma	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
iniquity	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
therefore	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
313	1
3	1
Now	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
had	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
Antionum	1
which	1
was	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
which	1
lay	1
nearly	1
bordering	1
upon	1
the	1
seashore	1
which	1
was	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
which	1
also	1
bordered	1
upon	1
the	1
wilderness	1
south	1
which	1
wilderness	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
314	1
4	1
Now	1
the	1
Nephites	1
greatly	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
would	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
correspondence	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
great	1
loss	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
315	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
tendency	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
justyea	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
more	1
powerful	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
than	1
the	1
sword	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
themtherefore	1
Alma	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
try	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
316	1
6	1
Therefore	1
he	1
took	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Omner	1
and	1
Himni	1
he	1
did	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Zarahemla	1
but	1
the	1
former	1
three	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
Amulek	1
and	1
Zeezrom	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Melek	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
took	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
Alma	1
317	1
7	1
Now	1
the	1
eldest	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
he	1
took	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Helaman	1
but	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
Shiblon	1
and	1
Corianton	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
Alma	1
318	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
were	1
dissenters	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
therefore	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
319	1
9	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
great	1
errors	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Alma	1
3110	1
10	1
Neither	1
would	1
they	1
observe	1
the	1
performances	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
to	1
God	1
daily	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation	1
Alma	1
3111	1
11	1
Yea	1
in	1
fine	1
they	1
did	1
pervert	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
very	1
many	1
instances	1
therefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
3112	1
12	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
behold	1
to	1
their	1
astonishment	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
had	1
built	1
synagogues	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
on	1
one	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
which	1
day	1
they	1
did	1
call	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
worship	1
after	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
had	1
never	1
beheld	1
Alma	1
3113	1
13	1
For	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
place	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
their	1
synagogue	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
standing	1
which	1
was	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
would	1
only	1
admit	1
one	1
person	1
Alma	1
3114	1
14	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
desired	1
to	1
worship	1
must	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
and	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
towards	1
heaven	1
and	1
cry	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
Alma	1
3115	1
15	1
Holy	1
holy	1
God	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
God	1
and	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
holy	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
a	1
spirit	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
spirit	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
a	1
spirit	1
forever	1
Alma	1
3116	1
16	1
Holy	1
God	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
separated	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
brethren	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
which	1
was	1
handed	1
down	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
childishness	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
but	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
elected	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
holy	1
children	1
and	1
also	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
3117	1
17	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
elected	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
whilst	1
all	1
around	1
us	1
are	1
elected	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
by	1
thy	1
wrath	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
holiness	1
O	1
God	1
we	1
thank	1
thee	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
elected	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
foolish	1
traditions	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
which	1
doth	1
bind	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
belief	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
doth	1
lead	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
wander	1
far	1
from	1
thee	1
our	1
God	1
Alma	1
3118	1
18	1
And	1
again	1
we	1
thank	1
thee	1
O	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
and	1
a	1
holy	1
people	1
Amen	1
Alma	1
3119	1
19	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
prayers	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
beyond	1
all	1
measure	1
Alma	1
3120	1
20	1
For	1
behold	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
offer	1
up	1
these	1
same	1
prayers	1
Alma	1
3121	1
21	1
Now	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
called	1
by	1
them	1
Rameumptom	1
which	1
being	1
interpreted	1
is	1
the	1
holy	1
stand	1
Alma	1
3122	1
22	1
Now	1
from	1
this	1
stand	1
they	1
did	1
offer	1
up	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
selfsame	1
prayer	1
unto	1
God	1
thanking	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
chosen	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
lead	1
them	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
not	1
stolen	1
away	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
which	1
they	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
Alma	1
3123	1
23	1
Now	1
after	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
all	1
offered	1
up	1
thanks	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
never	1
speaking	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
again	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
together	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
stand	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
thanks	1
after	1
their	1
manner	1
Alma	1
3124	1
24	1
Now	1
when	1
Alma	1
saw	1
this	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
wicked	1
and	1
a	1
perverse	1
people	1
yea	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
set	1
upon	1
gold	1
and	1
upon	1
silver	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fine	1
goods	1
Alma	1
3125	1
25	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
unto	1
great	1
boasting	1
in	1
their	1
pride	1
Alma	1
3126	1
26	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
cried	1
saying	1
O	1
how	1
long	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
that	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
dwell	1
here	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
behold	1
such	1
gross	1
wickedness	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
3127	1
27	1
Behold	1
O	1
God	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
yet	1
their	1
hearts	1
are	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
pride	1
Behold	1
O	1
God	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
mouths	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
puffed	1
up	1
even	1
to	1
greatness	1
with	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
3128	1
28	1
Behold	1
O	1
my	1
God	1
their	1
costly	1
apparel	1
and	1
their	1
ringlets	1
and	1
their	1
bracelets	1
and	1
their	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
ornamented	1
with	1
and	1
behold	1
their	1
hearts	1
are	1
set	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
sayWe	1
thank	1
thee	1
O	1
God	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
people	1
unto	1
thee	1
while	1
others	1
shall	1
perish	1
Alma	1
3129	1
29	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1

O	1
Lord	1

how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
that	1
such	1
wickedness	1
and	1
infidelity	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1

people	1
O	1

give	1
me	1

O	1

of	1
the	1

O	1

that	1

that	1

because	1
of	1

34	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
grant	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
success	1
in	1
bringing	1

again	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
3135	1
35	1
Behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
their	1
souls	1
are	1
precious	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
our	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
give	1
unto	1
us	1
O	1
Lord	1
power	1
and	1
wisdom	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
bring	1
these	1
our	1
brethren	1
again	1
unto	1
thee	1
Alma	1
3136	1
36	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
behold	1
as	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
Alma	1
3137	1
37	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
separate	1
themselves	1
one	1
from	1
another	1
taking	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
themselves	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
eat	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
drink	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
put	1
on	1
Alma	1
3138	1
38	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
provided	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
hunger	1
not	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
thirst	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
gave	1
them	1
strength	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Christ	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
prayed	1
in	1
faith	1
Alma	1
32	1
Chapter	1
32	1
Alma	1
321	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
entering	1
into	1
their	1
synagogues	1
and	1
into	1
their	1
houses	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
their	1
streets	1
Alma	1
322	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
much	1
labor	1
among	1
them	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
success	1
among	1
the	1
poor	1
class	1
of	1
people	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
coarseness	1
of	1
their	1
apparel	1
Alma	1
323	1
3	1
Therefore	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
synagogues	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
being	1
esteemed	1
as	1
filthiness	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
poor	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
esteemed	1
by	1
their	1
brethren	1
as	1
dross	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
poor	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
poor	1
in	1
heart	1
Alma	1
324	1
4	1
Now	1
as	1
Alma	1
was	1
teaching	1
and	1
speaking	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
Onidah	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
unto	1
him	1
who	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
speaking	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
poor	1
in	1
heart	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
poverty	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
325	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Alma	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
foremost	1
among	1
them	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
what	1
shall	1
these	1
my	1
brethren	1
do	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
despised	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
poverty	1
yea	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
by	1
our	1
priests	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
synagogues	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
labored	1
abundantly	1
to	1
build	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
out	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
exceeding	1
poverty	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
worship	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
behold	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
Alma	1
326	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Alma	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
turned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
face	1
immediately	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
beheld	1
with	1
great	1
joy	1
for	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
their	1
afflictions	1
had	1
truly	1
humbled	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
preparation	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
Alma	1
327	1
7	1
Therefore	1
he	1
did	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
multitude	1
but	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
beheld	1
who	1
were	1
truly	1
penitent	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
328	1
8	1
I	1
behold	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
Alma	1
329	1
9	1
Behold	1
thy	1
brother	1
hath	1
said	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
dofor	1
we	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
synagogues	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
worship	1
our	1
God	1
Alma	1
3210	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
worship	1
God	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
synagogues	1
only	1
Alma	1
3211	1
11	1
Moreover	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
not	1
worship	1
God	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
Alma	1
3212	1
12	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
synagogues	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
humble	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
despised	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
exceeding	1
poverty	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
lowliness	1
of	1
heart	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
necessarily	1
brought	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
Alma	1
3213	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
sometimes	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
seeketh	1
repentance	1
and	1
now	1
surely	1
whosoever	1
repenteth	1
shall	1
find	1
mercy	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
findeth	1
mercy	1
and	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
Alma	1
3214	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
ye	1
were	1
blessed	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
blessed	1
who	1
truly	1
humble	1
themselves	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
Alma	1
3215	1
15	1
Yea	1
he	1
that	1
truly	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
and	1
repenteth	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
blessedyea	1
much	1
more	1
blessed	1
than	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
poverty	1
Alma	1
3216	1
16	1
Therefore	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
humble	1
themselves	1
without	1
being	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
humble	1
or	1
rather	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
without	1
stubbornness	1
of	1
heart	1
yea	1
without	1
being	1
brought	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
word	1
or	1
even	1
compelled	1
to	1
know	1
before	1
they	1
will	1
believe	1
Alma	1
3217	1
17	1
Yea	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
do	1
say	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
show	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
believe	1
Alma	1
3218	1
18	1
Now	1
I	1
ask	1
is	1
this	1
faith	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
for	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
knoweth	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
believe	1
for	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
Alma	1
3219	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
cursed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
only	1
believeth	1
or	1
only	1
hath	1
cause	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
falleth	1
into	1
transgression	1
Alma	1
3220	1
20	1
Now	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
ye	1
must	1
judge	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
Alma	1
3221	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
concerning	1
faithfaith	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
things	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
ye	1
hope	1
for	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen	1
which	1
are	1
true	1
Alma	1
3222	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
merciful	1
unto	1
all	1
who	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
therefore	1
he	1
desireth	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
believe	1
yea	1
even	1
on	1
his	1
word	1
Alma	1
3223	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
imparteth	1
his	1
word	1
by	1
angels	1
unto	1
men	1
yea	1
not	1
only	1
men	1
but	1
women	1
also	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
little	1
children	1
do	1
have	1
words	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
many	1
times	1
which	1
confound	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
the	1
learned	1
Alma	1
3224	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
afflicted	1
and	1
cast	1
outnow	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
judge	1
you	1
only	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
true	1
Alma	1
3225	1
25	1
For	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
for	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
among	1
you	1
who	1
would	1
humble	1
themselves	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
circumstances	1
they	1
might	1
Alma	1
3226	1
26	1
Now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
concerning	1
faiththat	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledgeeven	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
my	1
words	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
surety	1
at	1
first	1
unto	1
perfection	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
faith	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
Alma	1
3227	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
awake	1
and	1
arouse	1
your	1
faculties	1
even	1
to	1
an	1
experiment	1
upon	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
exercise	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
faith	1
yea	1
even	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
desire	1
to	1
believe	1
let	1
this	1
desire	1
work	1
in	1
you	1
even	1
until	1
ye	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
give	1
place	1
for	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
Alma	1
3228	1
28	1
Now	1
we	1
will	1
compare	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
a	1
seed	1
Now	1
if	1
ye	1
give	1
place	1
that	1
a	1
seed	1
may	1
be	1
planted	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
behold	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
seed	1
or	1
a	1
good	1
seed	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
cast	1
it	1
out	1
by	1
your	1
unbelief	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
resist	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
behold	1
it	1
will	1
begin	1
to	1
swell	1
within	1
your	1
breasts	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
feel	1
these	1
swelling	1
motions	1
ye	1
will	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselvesIt	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
seed	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
enlarge	1
my	1
soul	1
yea	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
enlighten	1
my	1
understanding	1
yea	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
be	1
delicious	1
to	1
me	1
Alma	1
3229	1
29	1
Now	1
behold	1
would	1
not	1
this	1
increase	1
your	1
faith	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
grown	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
Alma	1
3230	1
30	1
But	1
behold	1
as	1
the	1
seed	1
swelleth	1
and	1
sprouteth	1
and	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
swelleth	1
and	1
sprouteth	1
and	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
will	1
not	1
this	1
strengthen	1
your	1
faith	1
Yea	1
it	1
will	1
strengthen	1
your	1
faith	1
for	1
ye	1
will	1
say	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
seed	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
sprouteth	1
and	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
Alma	1
3231	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
are	1
ye	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
seed	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
for	1
every	1
seed	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
unto	1
its	1
own	1
likeness	1
Alma	1
3232	1
32	1
Therefore	1
if	1
a	1
seed	1
groweth	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
groweth	1
not	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
cast	1
away	1
Alma	1
3233	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
tried	1
the	1
experiment	1
and	1
planted	1
the	1
seed	1
and	1
it	1
swelleth	1
and	1
sprouteth	1
and	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
is	1
good	1
Alma	1
3234	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
is	1
your	1
knowledge	1
perfect	1
Yea	1
your	1
knowledge	1
is	1
perfect	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
dormant	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
hath	1
swelled	1
your	1
souls	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
sprouted	1
up	1
that	1
your	1
understanding	1
doth	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
enlightened	1
and	1
your	1
mind	1
doth	1
begin	1
to	1
expand	1
Alma	1
3235	1
35	1
O	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
real	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
light	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
light	1
is	1
good	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
discernible	1
therefore	1
ye	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
tasted	1
this	1
light	1
is	1
your	1
knowledge	1
perfect	1
Alma	1
3236	1
36	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
neither	1
must	1
ye	1
lay	1
aside	1
your	1
faith	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
only	1
exercised	1
your	1
faith	1
to	1
plant	1
the	1
seed	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
try	1
the	1
experiment	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
the	1
seed	1
was	1
good	1
Alma	1
3237	1
37	1
And	1
behold	1
as	1
the	1
tree	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
ye	1
will	1
say	1
Let	1
us	1
nourish	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
care	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
get	1
root	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
grow	1
up	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
us	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
nourish	1
it	1
with	1
much	1
care	1
it	1
will	1
get	1
root	1
and	1
grow	1
up	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
Alma	1
3238	1
38	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
neglect	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
its	1
nourishment	1
behold	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
get	1
any	1
root	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
cometh	1
and	1
scorcheth	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1
root	1
it	1
withers	1
away	1
and	1
ye	1
pluck	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
out	1
Alma	1
3239	1
39	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
seed	1
was	1
not	1
good	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
because	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
desirable	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
your	1
ground	1
is	1
barren	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
nourish	1
the	1
tree	1
therefore	1
ye	1
cannot	1
have	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
Alma	1
3240	1
40	1
And	1
thus	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
nourish	1
the	1
word	1
looking	1
forward	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
faith	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
ye	1
can	1
never	1
pluck	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
Alma	1
3241	1
41	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
nourish	1
the	1
word	1
yea	1
nourish	1
the	1
tree	1
as	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
grow	1
by	1
your	1
faith	1
with	1
great	1
diligence	1
and	1
with	1
patience	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
it	1
shall	1
take	1
root	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
tree	1
springing	1
up	1
unto	1
everlasting	1
life	1
Alma	1
3242	1
42	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
diligence	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
your	1
patience	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
nourishing	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
take	1
root	1
in	1
you	1
behold	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
ye	1
shall	1
pluck	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
precious	1
which	1
is	1
sweet	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
sweet	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
white	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
white	1
yea	1
and	1
pure	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
pure	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
feast	1
upon	1
this	1
fruit	1
even	1
until	1
ye	1
are	1
filled	1
that	1
ye	1
hunger	1
not	1
neither	1

3243	1

Then	1
my	1

ye	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
rewards	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
your	1
diligence	1

Alma	1
331	1
1	1
Now	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
unto	1
him	1
desiring	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
in	1
one	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
this	1
fruit	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
or	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
plant	1
the	1
seed	1
or	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
must	1
be	1
planted	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
they	1
should	1
begin	1
to	1
exercise	1
their	1
faith	1
Alma	1
332	1
2	1
And	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
worship	1
your	1
God	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
synagogues	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
worship	1
God	1
ye	1
do	1
greatly	1
err	1
and	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
scriptures	1
if	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
this	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
Alma	1
333	1
3	1
Do	1
ye	1
remember	1
to	1
have	1
read	1
what	1
Zenos	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
old	1
has	1
said	1
concerning	1
prayer	1
or	1
worship	1
Alma	1
334	1
4	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
Thou	1
art	1
merciful	1
O	1
God	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
my	1
prayer	1
even	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
thou	1
wast	1
merciful	1
when	1
I	1
prayed	1
concerning	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
mine	1
enemies	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
Alma	1
335	1
5	1
Yea	1
O	1
God	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
field	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
prayer	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
me	1
Alma	1
336	1
6	1
And	1
again	1
O	1
God	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
prayer	1
Alma	1
337	1
7	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
turn	1
unto	1
my	1
closet	1
O	1
Lord	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
thee	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
me	1
Alma	1
338	1
8	1
Yea	1
thou	1
art	1
merciful	1
unto	1
thy	1
children	1
when	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
of	1
thee	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hear	1
them	1
Alma	1
339	1
9	1
Yea	1
O	1
God	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
heard	1
my	1
cries	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
congregations	1
Alma	1
3310	1
10	1
Yea	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
heard	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
despised	1
by	1
mine	1
enemies	1
yea	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
my	1
cries	1
and	1
wast	1
angry	1
with	1
mine	1
enemies	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
visit	1
them	1
in	1
thine	1
anger	1
with	1
speedy	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
3311	1
11	1
And	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
and	1
my	1
sincerity	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
Son	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
thus	1
merciful	1
unto	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
mine	1
afflictions	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
my	1
joy	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
turned	1
thy	1
judgments	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
Son	1
Alma	1
3312	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Do	1
ye	1
believe	1
those	1
scriptures	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
Alma	1
3313	1
13	1
Behold	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
ye	1
must	1
believe	1
what	1
Zenos	1
said	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
said	1
Thou	1
hast	1
turned	1
away	1
thy	1
judgments	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
Son	1
Alma	1
3314	1
14	1
Now	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
scriptures	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
disbelieve	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3315	1
15	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
written	1
that	1
Zenos	1
alone	1
spake	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
Zenock	1
also	1
spake	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
3316	1
16	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
said	1
Thou	1
art	1
angry	1
O	1
Lord	1
with	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
understand	1
thy	1
mercies	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
Son	1
Alma	1
3317	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
a	1
second	1
prophet	1
of	1
old	1
has	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
because	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
words	1
they	1
stoned	1
him	1
to	1
death	1
Alma	1
3318	1
18	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3319	1
19	1
Behold	1
he	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Moses	1
yea	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
type	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
whosoever	1
would	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
might	1
live	1
And	1
many	1
did	1
look	1
and	1
live	1
Alma	1
3320	1
20	1
But	1
few	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
were	1
so	1
hardened	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
therefore	1
they	1
perished	1
Now	1
the	1
reason	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
is	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
heal	1
them	1
Alma	1
3321	1
21	1
O	1
my	1
brethren	1
if	1
ye	1
could	1
be	1
healed	1
by	1
merely	1
casting	1
about	1
your	1
eyes	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
healed	1
would	1
ye	1
not	1
behold	1
quickly	1
or	1
would	1
ye	1
rather	1
harden	1
your	1
hearts	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
be	1
slothful	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
cast	1
about	1
your	1
eyes	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
perish	1
Alma	1
3322	1
22	1
If	1
so	1
wo	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
but	1
if	1
not	1
so	1
then	1
cast	1
about	1
your	1
eyes	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
and	1
die	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
shall	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
judgment	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
Alma	1
3323	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
plant	1
this	1
word	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
beginneth	1
to	1
swell	1
even	1
so	1
nourish	1
it	1
by	1
your	1
faith	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
will	1
become	1
a	1
tree	1
springing	1
up	1
in	1
you	1
unto	1
everlasting	1
life	1
And	1
then	1
may	1
God	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
burdens	1
may	1
be	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
And	1
even	1
all	1
this	1
can	1
ye	1
do	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
Amen	1
Alma	1
34	1
Chapter	1
34	1
Alma	1
341	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
Amulek	1
arose	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
saying	1
Alma	1
342	1
2	1
My	1
brethren	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
who	1
is	1
taught	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
taught	1
unto	1
you	1
bountifully	1
before	1
your	1
dissension	1
from	1
among	1
us	1
Alma	1
343	1
3	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
desired	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
what	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
afflictions	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
somewhat	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
prepare	1
your	1
minds	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
exhorted	1
you	1
unto	1
faith	1
and	1
to	1
patience	1
Alma	1
344	1
4	1
Yea	1
even	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
faith	1
as	1
even	1
to	1
plant	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
try	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
its	1
goodness	1
Alma	1
345	1
5	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
question	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
minds	1
is	1
whether	1
the	1
word	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
whether	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
346	1
6	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
beheld	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
has	1
proved	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
many	1
instances	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
unto	1
salvation	1
Alma	1
347	1
7	1
My	1
brother	1
has	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Zenos	1
that	1
redemption	1
cometh	1
through	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Zenock	1
and	1
also	1
he	1
has	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Moses	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
Alma	1
348	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
myself	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it	1
Alma	1
349	1
9	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
an	1
atonement	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
God	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
atonement	1
made	1
or	1
else	1
all	1
mankind	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
perish	1
yea	1
all	1
are	1
hardened	1
yea	1
all	1
are	1
fallen	1
and	1
are	1
lost	1
and	1
must	1
perish	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
Alma	1
3410	1
10	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
sacrifice	1
yea	1
not	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
man	1
neither	1
of	1
beast	1
neither	1
of	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
fowl	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
human	1
sacrifice	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
infinite	1
and	1
eternal	1
sacrifice	1
Alma	1
3411	1
11	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
which	1
will	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
another	1
Now	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
murdereth	1
behold	1
will	1
our	1
law	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
take	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
Alma	1
3412	1
12	1
But	1
the	1
law	1
requireth	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
murdered	1
therefore	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
which	1
is	1
short	1
of	1
an	1
infinite	1
atonement	1
which	1
will	1
suffice	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
3413	1
13	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
or	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
yea	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
fulfilled	1
every	1
jot	1
and	1
tittle	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
Alma	1
3414	1
14	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
every	1
whit	1
pointing	1
to	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
sacrifice	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
infinite	1
and	1
eternal	1
Alma	1
3415	1
15	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
salvation	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
intent	1
of	1
this	1
last	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercy	1
which	1
overpowereth	1
justice	1
and	1
bringeth	1
about	1
means	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
faith	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
3416	1
16	1
And	1
thus	1
mercy	1
can	1
satisfy	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
encircles	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
safety	1
while	1
he	1
that	1
exercises	1
no	1
faith	1
unto	1
repentance	1
is	1

therefore	1
only	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
has	1
faith	1
unto	1

about	1
the	1

Therefore	1
may	1
God	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
begin	1
to	1
exercise	1
your	1
faith	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
holy	1
name	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
you	1
Alma	1
3418	1
18	1
Yea	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
mercy	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mighty	1
to	1
save	1
Alma	1
3419	1
19	1
Yea	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
and	1
continue	1
in	1
prayer	1
unto	1
him	1
Alma	1
3420	1
20	1
Cry	1
unto	1
him	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
fields	1
yea	1
over	1
all	1
your	1
flocks	1
Alma	1
3421	1
21	1
Cry	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
your	1
houses	1
yea	1
over	1
all	1
your	1
household	1
both	1
morning	1
midday	1
and	1
evening	1
Alma	1
3422	1
22	1
Yea	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
3423	1
23	1
Yea	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
all	1
righteousness	1
Alma	1
3424	1
24	1
Cry	1
unto	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
crops	1
of	1
your	1
fields	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prosper	1
in	1
them	1
Alma	1
3425	1
25	1
Cry	1
over	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
your	1
fields	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
increase	1
Alma	1
3426	1
26	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
ye	1
must	1
pour	1
out	1
your	1
souls	1
in	1
your	1
closets	1
and	1
your	1
secret	1
places	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
3427	1
27	1
Yea	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
let	1
your	1
hearts	1
be	1
full	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
prayer	1
unto	1
him	1
continually	1
for	1
your	1
welfare	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
around	1
you	1
Alma	1
3428	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
for	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
if	1
ye	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
needy	1
and	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
visit	1
not	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
afflicted	1
and	1
impart	1
of	1
your	1
substance	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
stand	1
in	1
needI	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
behold	1
your	1
prayer	1
is	1
vain	1
and	1
availeth	1
you	1
nothing	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
as	1
hypocrites	1
who	1
do	1
deny	1
the	1
faith	1
Alma	1
3429	1
29	1
Therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
to	1
be	1
charitable	1
ye	1
are	1
as	1
dross	1
which	1
the	1
refiners	1
do	1
cast	1
out	1
it	1
being	1
of	1
no	1
worth	1
and	1
is	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
3430	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
so	1
many	1
witnesses	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures	1
testify	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
ye	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
bring	1
fruit	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
3431	1
31	1
Yea	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
any	1
longer	1
for	1
behold	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
salvation	1
and	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts	1
immediately	1
shall	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
be	1
brought	1
about	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
3432	1
32	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
men	1
to	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
God	1
yea	1
behold	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
for	1
men	1
to	1
perform	1
their	1
labors	1
Alma	1
3433	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
before	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
witnesses	1
therefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
procrastinate	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
repentance	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
for	1
after	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
us	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
eternity	1
behold	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
improve	1
our	1
time	1
while	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
darkness	1
wherein	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
labor	1
performed	1
Alma	1
3434	1
34	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
say	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
that	1
awful	1
crisis	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
repent	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
God	1
Nay	1
ye	1
cannot	1
say	1
this	1
for	1
that	1
same	1
spirit	1
which	1
doth	1
possess	1
your	1
bodies	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
ye	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
that	1
same	1
spirit	1
will	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
possess	1
your	1
body	1
in	1
that	1
eternal	1
world	1
Alma	1
3435	1
35	1
For	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
procrastinated	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
repentance	1
even	1
until	1
death	1
behold	1
ye	1
have	1
become	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
seal	1
you	1
his	1
therefore	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
hath	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
hath	1
all	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
final	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
Alma	1
3436	1
36	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
unholy	1
temples	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
doth	1
he	1
dwell	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out	1
but	1
their	1
garments	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
white	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
Alma	1
3437	1
37	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
deny	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
3438	1
38	1
That	1
ye	1
contend	1
no	1
more	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
it	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
that	1
ye	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
place	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
live	1
in	1
thanksgiving	1
daily	1
for	1
the	1
many	1
mercies	1
and	1
blessings	1
which	1
he	1
doth	1
bestow	1
upon	1
you	1
Alma	1
3439	1
39	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
exhort	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
watchful	1
unto	1
prayer	1
continually	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
overpower	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
become	1
his	1
subjects	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
rewardeth	1
you	1
no	1
good	1
thing	1
Alma	1
3440	1
40	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
patience	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
bear	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
revile	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
exceeding	1
poverty	1
lest	1
ye	1
become	1
sinners	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
3441	1
41	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
patience	1
and	1
bear	1
with	1
those	1
afflictions	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
hope	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
one	1
day	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
afflictions	1
Alma	1

Chapter	1
35	1
Alma	1
351	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Amulek	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
withdrew	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
Alma	1
352	1
2	1
Yea	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
also	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
Alma	1
353	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
more	1
popular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
had	1
consulted	1
together	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
did	1
destroy	1
their	1
craft	1
therefore	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
Alma	1
354	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
consulted	1
with	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
Alma	1
355	1
5	1
Now	1
their	1
rulers	1
and	1
their	1
priests	1
and	1
their	1
teachers	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
know	1
concerning	1
their	1
desires	1
therefore	1
they	1
found	1
out	1
privily	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
356	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
many	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
Alma	1
357	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
358	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
Jershon	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
wicked	1
man	1
sent	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
desiring	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
over	1
from	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
land	1
Alma	1
359	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
breathed	1
out	1
many	1
threatenings	1
against	1
them	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
their	1
words	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
receive	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
that	1
came	1
over	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
nourish	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
clothe	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
lands	1
for	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
administer	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
wants	1
Alma	1
3510	1
10	1
Now	1
this	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
mix	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
also	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
3511	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
also	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
3512	1
12	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
3513	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
and	1
gave	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
for	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
thus	1
commenced	1
a	1
war	1
betwixt	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
and	1
an	1
account	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
of	1
their	1
wars	1
hereafter	1
Alma	1
3514	1
14	1
And	1
Alma	1
and	1
Ammon	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Alma	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
instruments	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
bringing	1
many	1
of	1

were	1

driven	1
out	1

they	1
have	1
lands	1
for	1

the	1

they	1

Now	1
Alma	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
for	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
the	1
bloodsheds	1
and	1
the	1
contentions	1
which	1
were	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
or	1
sent	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
hard	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
strictness	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
Alma	1
3516	1
16	1
Therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
sons	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
charge	1
separately	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
unto	1
righteousness	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
commandments	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
record	1

1	1
My	1
son	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
362	1
2	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
remembering	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
and	1
none	1
could	1
deliver	1
them	1
except	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
he	1
surely	1
did	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
afflictions	1

And	1
now	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
Helaman	1
behold	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
thy	1
youth	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
of	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hear	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
learn	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
supported	1
in	1
their	1
trials	1
and	1
their	1
troubles	1
and	1
their	1
afflictions	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
364	1

And	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
myselfnot	1
of	1
the	1
temporal	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
spiritual	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
365	1
5	1
Now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
God	1
has	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
angel	1
made	1
these	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
worthiness	1
of	1
myself	1
Alma	1
366	1
6	1
For	1
I	1
went	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
seeking	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
behold	1
God	1
sent	1
his	1
holy	1
angel	1
to	1
stop	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
Alma	1
367	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
did	1
tremble	1
beneath	1
our	1
feet	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
us	1
Alma	1
368	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Arise	1
And	1
I	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
angel	1
Alma	1
369	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
of	1
thyself	1
be	1
destroyed	1
seek	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3610	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
neither	1
had	1
I	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
limbs	1
Alma	1
3611	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
spake	1
more	1
things	1
unto	1
me	1
which	1
were	1
heard	1
by	1
my	1
brethren	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
wordsIf	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
destroyed	1
of	1
thyself	1
seek	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
GodI	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
such	1
great	1
fear	1
and	1
amazement	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
that	1
I	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
hear	1
no	1
more	1
Alma	1
3612	1
12	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
racked	1
with	1
eternal	1
torment	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
harrowed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
degree	1
and	1
racked	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
sins	1
Alma	1
3613	1
13	1
Yea	1
I	1
did	1
remember	1
all	1
my	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
tormented	1
with	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
hell	1
yea	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
rebelled	1
against	1
my	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
kept	1
his	1
holy	1
commandments	1
Alma	1
3614	1
14	1
Yea	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
murdered	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
or	1
rather	1
led	1
them	1
away	1
unto	1
destruction	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
so	1
great	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
iniquities	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
did	1
rack	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
inexpressible	1
horror	1
Alma	1
3615	1
15	1
Oh	1
thought	1
I	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
banished	1
and	1
become	1
extinct	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
my	1
deeds	1
Alma	1
3616	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
nights	1
was	1
I	1
racked	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
a	1
damned	1
soul	1
Alma	1
3617	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
racked	1
with	1
torment	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
harrowed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
my	1
many	1
sins	1
behold	1
I	1
remembered	1
also	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
one	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
a	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
3618	1
18	1
Now	1
as	1
my	1
mind	1
caught	1
hold	1
upon	1
this	1
thought	1
I	1
cried	1
within	1
my	1
heart	1
O	1
Jesus	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me	1
who	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
am	1
encircled	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
everlasting	1
chains	1
of	1
death	1
Alma	1
3619	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
this	1
I	1
could	1
remember	1
my	1
pains	1
no	1
more	1
yea	1
I	1
was	1
harrowed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
no	1
more	1
Alma	1
3620	1
20	1
And	1
oh	1
what	1
joy	1
and	1
what	1
marvelous	1
light	1
I	1
did	1
behold	1
yea	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
as	1
exceeding	1
as	1
was	1
my	1
pain	1
Alma	1
3621	1
21	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
exquisite	1
and	1
so	1
bitter	1
as	1
were	1
my	1
pains	1
Yea	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
exquisite	1
and	1
sweet	1
as	1
was	1
my	1
joy	1
Alma	1
3622	1
22	1
Yea	1
methought	1
I	1
saw	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
saw	1
God	1
sitting	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
surrounded	1
with	1
numberless	1
concourses	1
of	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
singing	1
and	1
praising	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
did	1
long	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
Alma	1
3623	1
23	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
limbs	1
did	1
receive	1
their	1
strength	1
again	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
did	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3624	1
24	1
Yea	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
even	1
until	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
labored	1
without	1
ceasing	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
bring	1
souls	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
joy	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
taste	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
also	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
Alma	1
3625	1
25	1
Yea	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
the	1
Lord	1
doth	1
give	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
labors	1
Alma	1
3626	1
26	1
For	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
imparted	1
unto	1
me	1
behold	1
many	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
tasted	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
eye	1
to	1
eye	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
therefore	1
they	1
do	1
know	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
3627	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
supported	1
under	1
trials	1
and	1
troubles	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
yea	1
God	1
has	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
prison	1
and	1
from	1
bonds	1
and	1
from	1
death	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
still	1
deliver	1
me	1
Alma	1
3628	1
28	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
glory	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
him	1
forever	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
into	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
and	1
captivity	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
Alma	1
3629	1
29	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
brought	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
by	1
his	1
everlasting	1
power	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
bondage	1
and	1
captivity	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
retained	1
in	1
remembrance	1
their	1
captivity	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
also	1
ought	1
to	1
retain	1
in	1
remembrance	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
their	1
captivity	1
Alma	1
3630	1
30	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
for	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
also	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
according	1
to	1

37	1
Alma	1
371	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
Helaman	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
entrusted	1
with	1
me	1
Alma	1
372	1

And	1
I	1
also	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
keep	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
sacred	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
a	1
wise	1
purpose	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
kept	1

And	1
these	1

upon	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
our	1
forefathers	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Alma	1
374	1

Behold	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
prophesied	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
one	1
generation	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
until	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
contained	1
thereon	1
Alma	1
375	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
kept	1
they	1
must	1
retain	1
their	1
brightness	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
retain	1
their	1
brightness	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
plates	1
which	1
do	1
contain	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy	1
writ	1
Alma	1
376	1
6	1
Now	1
ye	1
may	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
foolishness	1
in	1
me	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
by	1
small	1
and	1
simple	1
things	1
are	1
great	1
things	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
and	1
small	1
means	1
in	1
many	1
instances	1
doth	1
confound	1
the	1
wise	1
Alma	1
377	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
doth	1
work	1
by	1
means	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
his	1
great	1
and	1
eternal	1
purposes	1
and	1
by	1
very	1
small	1
means	1
the	1
Lord	1
doth	1
confound	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
bringeth	1
about	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
many	1
souls	1
Alma	1
378	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
has	1
hitherto	1
been	1
wisdom	1
in	1
God	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
preserved	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
enlarged	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
convinced	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
their	1
ways	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
Alma	1
379	1
9	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
these	1
records	1
do	1
contain	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
these	1
plates	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
convinced	1
so	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
of	1
the	1
incorrect	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
yea	1
these	1
records	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
is	1
they	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
Alma	1
3710	1
10	1
And	1
who	1
knoweth	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
our	1
stiffnecked	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
hardening	1
their	1
hearts	1
in	1
sin	1
and	1
iniquities	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
Alma	1
3711	1
11	1
Now	1
these	1
mysteries	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
fully	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
shall	1
forbear	1
Alma	1
3712	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
suffice	1
if	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
preserved	1
for	1
a	1
wise	1
purpose	1
which	1
purpose	1
is	1
known	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
doth	1
counsel	1
in	1
wisdom	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
and	1
his	1
paths	1
are	1
straight	1
and	1
his	1
course	1
is	1
one	1
eternal	1
round	1
Alma	1
3713	1
13	1
O	1
remember	1
remember	1
my	1
son	1
Helaman	1
how	1
strict	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
landbut	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
not	1
his	1
commandments	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
Alma	1
3714	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
remember	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
entrusted	1
you	1
with	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
sacred	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
kept	1
sacred	1
and	1
also	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
and	1
preserve	1
for	1
a	1
wise	1
purpose	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
future	1
generations	1
Alma	1
3715	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
sacred	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
up	1
unto	1
Satan	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sift	1
you	1
as	1
chaff	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
Alma	1
3716	1
16	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
sacred	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
doth	1
command	1
you	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
appeal	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
must	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
behold	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
earth	1
or	1
hell	1
can	1
take	1
them	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
powerful	1
to	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
Alma	1
3717	1
17	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
fulfil	1
all	1
his	1
promises	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
promises	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
Alma	1
3718	1
18	1
For	1
he	1
promised	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
preserve	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
wise	1
purpose	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
future	1
generations	1
Alma	1
3719	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
one	1
purpose	1
hath	1
he	1
fulfilled	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
shown	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
also	1
still	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
them	1
unto	1
future	1
generations	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
preserved	1
Alma	1
3720	1
20	1
Therefore	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
Helaman	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
diligent	1
in	1
fulfilling	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
diligent	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
Alma	1
3721	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
those	1
twentyfour	1
plates	1
that	1
ye	1
keep	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
mysteries	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
their	1
secret	1
works	1
or	1
the	1
secret	1
works	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
all	1
their	1
murders	1
and	1
robbings	1
and	1
their	1
plunderings	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
preserve	1
these	1
interpreters	1
Alma	1
3722	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
darkness	1
yea	1
work	1
secret	1
murders	1
and	1
abominations	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
3723	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
unto	1
my	1
servant	1
Gazelem	1
a	1
stone	1
which	1
shall	1
shine	1
forth	1
in	1
darkness	1
unto	1
light	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
discover	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
serve	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
discover	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
yea	1
their	1
secret	1
works	1
their	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
Alma	1
3724	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
these	1
interpreters	1
were	1
prepared	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
saying	1
Alma	1
3725	1
25	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
unto	1
light	1
all	1
their	1
secret	1
works	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
and	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
light	1
all	1
their	1
secrets	1
and	1
abominations	1
unto	1
every	1
nation	1
that	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
3726	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
and	1
thus	1
far	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
has	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
yea	1
their	1
secret	1
abominations	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
Alma	1
3727	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
retain	1
all	1
their	1
oaths	1
and	1
their	1
covenants	1
and	1
their	1
agreements	1
in	1
their	1
secret	1
abominations	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
signs	1
and	1
their	1
wonders	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
from	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
them	1
not	1
lest	1
peradventure	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
darkness	1
also	1
and	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
3728	1
28	1
For	1
behold	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
all	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
destruction	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
those	1
workers	1
of	1
darkness	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe	1
therefore	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
3729	1
29	1
Therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
these	1
secret	1
plans	1
of	1
their	1
oaths	1
and	1
their	1
covenants	1
from	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
only	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
murders	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
abhor	1
such	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
and	1
murders	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
teach	1
them	1
that	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
destroyed	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
and	1
their	1
murders	1
Alma	1
3730	1
30	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
murdered	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
who	1
came	1
among	1
them	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
murdered	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
their	1
murderers	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
these	1
workers	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
secret	1
combinations	1
Alma	1
3731	1
31	1
Yea	1
and	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
land	1
forever	1
and	1
ever	1
unto	1
those	1
workers	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
secret	1
combinations	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
before	1
they	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe	1
Alma	1
3732	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
trust	1
not	1
those	1
secret	1
plans	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
but	1
teach	1
them	1
an	1
everlasting	1
hatred	1
against	1
sin	1
and	1
iniquity	1
Alma	1
3733	1
33	1
Preach	1
unto	1
them	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
humble	1
themselves	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart	1
teach	1
them	1
to	1
withstand	1
every	1
temptation	1
of	1
the	1

with	1
their	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
3734	1
34	1
Teach	1
them	1
to	1
never	1
be	1
weary	1
of	1
good	1
works	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart	1
for	1
such	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
to	1
their	1

if	1
ye	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
3738	1
38	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
concerning	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
our	1
fathers	1
call	1
a	1
ball	1
or	1
directoror	1
our	1
fathers	1
called	1
it	1
Liahona	1
which	1
is	1
being	1
interpreted	1
a	1
compass	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
prepared	1
it	1
Alma	1
3739	1
39	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
cannot	1
any	1
man	1
work	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
so	1
curious	1
a	1
workmanship	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
show	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
the	1
course	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
3740	1
40	1
And	1
it	1
did	1
work	1
for	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
therefore	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
faith	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
God	1
could	1
cause	1
that	1
those	1
spindles	1
should	1
point	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
therefore	1
they	1
had	1
this	1
miracle	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
Alma	1
3741	1
41	1
Nevertheless	1
because	1
those	1
miracles	1
were	1
worked	1
by	1
small	1
means	1
it	1
did	1
show	1
unto	1
them	1
marvelous	1
works	1
They	1
were	1
slothful	1
and	1
forgot	1
to	1
exercise	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
diligence	1
and	1
then	1
those	1
marvelous	1
works	1
ceased	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
progress	1
in	1
their	1
journey	1
Alma	1
3742	1
42	1
Therefore	1
they	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
travel	1
a	1
direct	1
course	1
and	1
were	1
afflicted	1
with	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions	1
Alma	1
3743	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
understand	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
without	1
a	1
shadow	1
for	1
as	1
our	1
fathers	1
were	1
slothful	1
to	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
this	1
compass	1
now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
temporal	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
prosper	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual	1
Alma	1
3744	1
44	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
will	1
point	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
eternal	1
bliss	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
our	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
this	1
compass	1
which	1
would	1
point	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
Alma	1
3745	1
45	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
type	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
For	1
just	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
this	1
director	1
did	1
bring	1
our	1
fathers	1
by	1
following	1
its	1
course	1
to	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
shall	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
if	1
we	1
follow	1
their	1
course	1
carry	1
us	1
beyond	1
this	1
vale	1
of	1
sorrow	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
better	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
Alma	1
3746	1
46	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
slothful	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
easiness	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
so	1
was	1
it	1
with	1
our	1
fathers	1
for	1
so	1
was	1
it	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
look	1
they	1
might	1
live	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
The	1
way	1
is	1
prepared	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
will	1
look	1
we	1
may	1
live	1
forever	1
Alma	1
3747	1
47	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
these	1
sacred	1
things	1
yea	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
live	1
Go	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
be	1
sober	1
My	1

farewell	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
381	1
1	1
My	1
son	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Helaman	1
that	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
Alma	1
382	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
steadiness	1
and	1
your	1
faithfulness	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
commenced	1
in	1
your	1
youth	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
continue	1
in	1
keeping	1
his	1
commandments	1
for	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
Alma	1
383	1
3	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
thee	1
already	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
thy	1
diligence	1
and	1
thy	1
patience	1
and	1
thy	1
longsuffering	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
Alma	1
384	1
4	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
in	1
bonds	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
stoned	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
sake	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
bear	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
with	1
patience	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
now	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
deliver	1
thee	1
Alma	1
385	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
Shiblon	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
trials	1
and	1
your	1
troubles	1
and	1
your	1
afflictions	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
386	1
6	1
Now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
myself	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
which	1
maketh	1
these	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
387	1
7	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
mercy	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
stop	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
as	1
thunder	1
and	1
it	1
shook	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
Alma	1
388	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
bitter	1
pain	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
never	1
until	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
mercy	1
did	1
I	1
receive	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
find	1
peace	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
Alma	1
389	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
or	1
means	1
whereby	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
only	1
in	1
and	1
through	1
Christ	1
Behold	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Behold	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
righteousness	1
Alma	1
3810	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
be	1
diligent	1
and	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
Alma	1
3811	1
11	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
lifted	1
up	1
unto	1
pride	1
yea	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
boast	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
wisdom	1
nor	1
of	1
your	1
much	1
strength	1
Alma	1
3812	1
12	1
Use	1
boldness	1
but	1
not	1
overbearance	1
and	1
also	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
bridle	1
all	1
your	1
passions	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
love	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
refrain	1
from	1
idleness	1
Alma	1
3813	1
13	1
Do	1
not	1
pray	1
as	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
do	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
they	1
pray	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
praised	1
for	1
their	1
wisdom	1
Alma	1
3814	1
14	1
Do	1
not	1
say	1
O	1
God	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
our	1
brethren	1
but	1
rather	1
say	1
O	1
Lord	1
forgive	1
my	1
unworthiness	1
and	1
remember	1
my	1
brethren	1
in	1
mercyyea	1
acknowledge	1
your	1
unworthiness	1
before	1
God	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
Alma	1
3815	1
15	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
your	1
soul	1
and	1
receive	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
peace	1
Now	1
go	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
Be	1
sober	1
My	1
son	1
farewell	1
Alma	1
39	1
Chapter	1
39	1
Alma	1
391	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
than	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother	1
for	1
behold	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
observed	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
his	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
his	1
diligence	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Behold	1
has	1
he	1
not	1
set	1
a	1
good	1
example	1
for	1
thee	1
Alma	1
392	1
2	1
For	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
give	1
so	1
much	1
heed	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
as	1
did	1
thy	1
brother	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
against	1
thee	1
thou	1
didst	1
go	1
on	1
unto	1
boasting	1
in	1
thy	1
strength	1
and	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
Alma	1
393	1
3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
my	1
son	1
Thou	1
didst	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
grievous	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
thou	1
didst	1
forsake	1
the	1
ministry	1
and	1
did	1
go	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Siron	1
among	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
after	1
the	1
harlot	1
Isabel	1
Alma	1
394	1
4	1
Yea	1
she	1
did	1
steal	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
excuse	1
for	1
thee	1
my	1
son	1
Thou	1
shouldst	1
have	1
tended	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
wast	1
entrusted	1
Alma	1
395	1
5	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
abomination	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
most	1
abominable	1
above	1
all	1
sins	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
innocent	1
blood	1
or	1
denying	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
Alma	1
396	1

For	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
deny	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
when	1
it	1
once	1
has	1
had	1
place	1
in	1
you	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
deny	1
it	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
unpardonable	1
yea	1
and	1
whosoever	1
murdereth	1
against	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
obtain	1
forgiveness	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
forgiveness	1
Alma	1
397	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
crime	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
dwell	1
upon	1
your	1
crimes	1
to	1
harrow	1
up	1
your	1
soul	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
good	1
Alma	1
398	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hide	1
your	1
crimes	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
they	1
will	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Alma	1
399	1
9	1
Now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
repent	1
and	1
forsake	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
after	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
your	1
eyes	1
but	1
cross	1
yourself	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
except	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
ye	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Oh	1
remember	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1

Behold	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
how	1
great	1
iniquity	1
ye	1
brought	1
upon	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
for	1
when	1
they	1

they	1

And	1
now	1

unto	1

Command	1
thy	1

good	1
lest	1
they	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1

therefore	1
I	1
command	1
you	1

that	1
ye	1
refrain	1

That	1
ye	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
your	1

and	1
strength	1
that	1
ye	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
no	1

rather	1
return	1

that	1

which	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1

Seek	1
not	1

the	1

behold	1
you	1
cannot	1

with	1
you	1
Alma	1
3915	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
somewhat	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
surely	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
yea	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
declare	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
salvation	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
3916	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
ministry	1
unto	1
which	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
to	1
declare	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
prepare	1
their	1
minds	1
or	1
rather	1
that	1
salvation	1
might	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
prepare	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
Alma	1
3917	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
ease	1
your	1
mind	1
somewhat	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
Behold	1
you	1
marvel	1
why	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
known	1
so	1
long	1
beforehand	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
as	1
precious	1
unto	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
soul	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1

3918	1

Is	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
their	1
children	1
Alma	1
3919	1
19	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
easy	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
send	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
declare	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings	1
unto	1
us	1

unto	1

1	1
Now	1
my	1
son	1
here	1
is	1
somewhat	1
more	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thy	1
mind	1
is	1
worried	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1

402	1

Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrectionor	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
that	1
this	1
mortal	1
does	1
not	1
put	1
on	1
immortality	1
this	1
corruption	1
does	1
not	1
put	1
on	1

after	1
the	1

Behold	1
he	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
the	1
resurrection	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
Now	1
I	1
unfold	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
mystery	1
nevertheless	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
mysteries	1
which	1
are	1
kept	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
knoweth	1
them	1
save	1
God	1
himself	1
But	1
I	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
inquired	1
diligently	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
knowthat	1
is	1
concerning	1
the	1
resurrection	1
Alma	1
404	1
4	1
Behold	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
appointed	1
that	1
all	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
time	1
cometh	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
but	1
God	1
knoweth	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
is	1
appointed	1
Alma	1
405	1
5	1
Now	1
whether	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
time	1
or	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
or	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
men	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
it	1
mattereth	1
not	1
for	1
God	1
knoweth	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
casethat	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
appointed	1
that	1
all	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
Alma	1
406	1
6	1
Now	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
space	1
betwixt	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
Alma	1
407	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
inquire	1
what	1
becometh	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
death	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
resurrection	1
Alma	1
408	1
8	1
Now	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
men	1
to	1
rise	1
it	1
mattereth	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
do	1
not	1
die	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
this	1
mattereth	1
not	1
all	1
is	1
as	1
one	1
day	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
time	1
only	1
is	1
measured	1
unto	1
men	1
Alma	1
409	1
9	1
Therefore	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
And	1
now	1
concerning	1
this	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
what	1
becometh	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
inquired	1
diligently	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
Alma	1
4010	1
10	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
when	1
all	1
shall	1
rise	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
knoweth	1
all	1
the	1
times	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
unto	1
man	1
Alma	1
4011	1
11	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
between	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
resurrectionBehold	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
an	1
angel	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
this	1
mortal	1
body	1
yea	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
are	1
taken	1
home	1
to	1
that	1
God	1
who	1
gave	1
them	1
life	1
Alma	1
4012	1
12	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
righteous	1
are	1
received	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
paradise	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
rest	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
peace	1
where	1
they	1
shall	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
their	1
troubles	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
care	1
and	1
sorrow	1
Alma	1
4013	1
13	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
yea	1
who	1
are	1
evilfor	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
nor	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
chose	1
evil	1
works	1
rather	1
than	1
good	1
therefore	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
them	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
houseand	1
these	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
iniquity	1
being	1
led	1
captive	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Alma	1
4014	1
14	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
yea	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
awful	1
fearful	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
fiery	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
them	1
thus	1
they	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
righteous	1
in	1
paradise	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
resurrection	1
Alma	1
4015	1
15	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
that	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
misery	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
before	1
the	1
resurrection	1
was	1
a	1
first	1
resurrection	1
Yea	1
I	1
admit	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
termed	1
a	1
resurrection	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
or	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
their	1
consignation	1
to	1
happiness	1
or	1
misery	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
Alma	1
4016	1
16	1
And	1
behold	1
again	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
first	1
resurrection	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
or	1
who	1
are	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
Alma	1
4017	1
17	1
Now	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
first	1
resurrection	1
which	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
and	1
their	1
consignation	1
to	1
happiness	1
or	1
misery	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
it	1
meaneth	1
Alma	1
4018	1
18	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
but	1
it	1
meaneth	1
the	1
reuniting	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
with	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
those	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Adam	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
4019	1
19	1
Now	1
whether	1
the	1
souls	1
and	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
reunited	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
wicked	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
righteous	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
let	1
it	1
suffice	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
come	1
forth	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
their	1
resurrection	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass	1
before	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
die	1
after	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
4020	1
20	1
Now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
their	1
resurrection	1
cometh	1
at	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
as	1
my	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
souls	1
and	1
the	1
bodies	1
are	1
reunited	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
at	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
his	1
ascension	1
into	1
heaven	1
Alma	1
4021	1
21	1
But	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
resurrection	1
or	1
after	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
but	1
this	1
much	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
space	1
between	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
in	1
happiness	1
or	1
in	1
misery	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
is	1
appointed	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
be	1
reunited	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
and	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
Alma	1
4022	1
22	1
Yea	1
this	1
bringeth	1
about	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
Alma	1
4023	1
23	1
The	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
yea	1
and	1
every	1
limb	1
and	1
joint	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
body	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lost	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
and	1
perfect	1
frame	1
Alma	1
4024	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
Alma	1
4025	1
25	1
And	1

But	1
behold	1
an	1
awful	1
death	1
cometh	1
upon	1

they	1
die	1
as	1
to	1
things	1

they	1

no	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
concerning	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
for	1
behold	1
some	1
have	1
wrested	1
the	1
scriptures	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
far	1
astray	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
And	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thy	1
mind	1
has	1
been	1
worried	1
also	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
Alma	1
412	1
2	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
restoration	1
is	1
requisite	1
with	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
requisite	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
order	1
Behold	1
it	1
is	1
requisite	1
and	1
just	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
its	1
body	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
itself	1
Alma	1
413	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
requisite	1
with	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
works	1
were	1
good	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
good	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
Alma	1
414	1
4	1
And	1
if	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
evil	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
evil	1
Therefore	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
order	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
its	1

to	1

The	1

to	1

according	1
to	1
his	1
desires	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
good	1
according	1
to	1

the	1

according	1
to	1

for	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
desired	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
all	1
the	1

long	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
his	1
reward	1
of	1

when	1

cometh	1
Alma	1
416	1

And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
If	1
he	1
hath	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
desired	1
righteousness	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
even	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded	1
unto	1
righteousness	1

These	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
taken	1
out	1
that	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
that	1
endless	1
night	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
stand	1
or	1
fall	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
their	1
own	1
judges	1
whether	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
or	1
do	1
evil	1
Alma	1

Now	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
unalterable	1
therefore	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
prepared	1
that	1
whosoever	1
will	1
may	1
walk	1
therein	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
do	1
not	1
risk	1
one	1
more	1
offense	1
against	1
your	1
God	1
upon	1
those	1
points	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
hitherto	1
risked	1
to	1
commit	1
sin	1
Alma	1
4110	1
10	1
Do	1
not	1
suppose	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
restoration	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
from	1
sin	1
to	1
happiness	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
wickedness	1
never	1
was	1
happiness	1
Alma	1
4111	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
nature	1
or	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
carnal	1
state	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
iniquity	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
God	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
happiness	1
Alma	1
4112	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
restoration	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
a	1
natural	1
state	1
and	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
state	1
or	1
to	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
opposite	1
to	1
its	1
nature	1
Alma	1
4113	1
13	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
case	1
but	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
restoration	1
is	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
again	1
evil	1
for	1
evil	1
or	1
carnal	1
for	1
carnal	1
or	1
devilish	1
for	1
devilishgood	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
righteous	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
righteous	1
just	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
merciful	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
merciful	1
Alma	1
4114	1
14	1
Therefore	1
my	1
son	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
merciful	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren	1
deal	1
justly	1
judge	1
righteously	1
and	1
do	1
good	1
continually	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive	1
your	1
reward	1
yea	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
mercy	1
restored	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
justice	1
restored	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
restored	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
good	1
rewarded	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
Alma	1
4115	1
15	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
send	1
out	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
be	1
restored	1
therefore	1
the	1
word	1
restoration	1
more	1
fully	1
condemneth	1
the	1
sinner	1
and	1
justifieth	1
him	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
Alma	1

Chapter	1
42	1
Alma	1
421	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
perceive	1
there	1
is	1
somewhat	1
more	1
which	1
doth	1
worry	1
your	1
mind	1
which	1
ye	1
cannot	1
understandwhich	1
is	1
concerning	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
sinner	1
for	1
ye	1
do	1
try	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
injustice	1
that	1
the	1
sinner	1
should	1
be	1
consigned	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
misery	1
Alma	1
422	1
2	1
Now	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
thee	1
For	1
behold	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
sent	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
were	1
takenyea	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
east	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
cherubim	1
and	1
a	1
flaming	1
sword	1
which	1
turned	1
every	1
way	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
Alma	1
423	1
3	1
Now	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
become	1
as	1
God	1
knowing	1
good	1
and	1
evil	1
and	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
take	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
eat	1
and	1
live	1
forever	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
placed	1
cherubim	1
and	1
the	1
flaming	1
sword	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
Alma	1
424	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
granted	1
unto	1
man	1
to	1
repent	1
yea	1
a	1
probationary	1
time	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
serve	1
God	1
Alma	1
425	1
5	1
For	1
behold	1
if	1
Adam	1
had	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
immediately	1
and	1
partaken	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
lived	1
forever	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
having	1
no	1
space	1
for	1
repentance	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
void	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
salvation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
frustrated	1
Alma	1
426	1
6	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
appointed	1
unto	1
man	1
to	1
dietherefore	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earthand	1
man	1
became	1
lost	1
forever	1
yea	1
they	1
became	1
fallen	1
man	1
Alma	1
427	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
by	1
this	1
that	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
both	1
temporally	1
and	1
spiritually	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
they	1
became	1
subjects	1
to	1
follow	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
will	1
Alma	1
428	1
8	1
Now	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
reclaimed	1
from	1
this	1
temporal	1
death	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
happiness	1
Alma	1
429	1
9	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
soul	1
could	1
never	1
die	1
and	1
the	1
fall	1
had	1
brought	1
upon	1
all	1
mankind	1
a	1
spiritual	1
death	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
temporal	1
that	1
is	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
mankind	1
should	1
be	1
reclaimed	1
from	1
this	1
spiritual	1
death	1
Alma	1
4210	1
10	1
Therefore	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
carnal	1
sensual	1
and	1
devilish	1
by	1
nature	1
this	1
probationary	1
state	1
became	1
a	1
state	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
prepare	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
preparatory	1
state	1
Alma	1
4211	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
remember	1
my	1
son	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
laying	1
it	1
aside	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
dead	1
their	1
souls	1
were	1
miserable	1
being	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
4212	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
means	1
to	1
reclaim	1
men	1
from	1
this	1
fallen	1
state	1
which	1
man	1
had	1
brought	1
upon	1
himself	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
disobedience	1
Alma	1
4213	1
13	1
Therefore	1
according	1
to	1
justice	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
redemption	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
about	1
only	1
on	1
conditions	1
of	1
repentance	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
probationary	1
state	1
yea	1
this	1
preparatory	1
state	1
for	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
these	1
conditions	1
mercy	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
effect	1
except	1
it	1
should	1
destroy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
justice	1
Now	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
justice	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
if	1
so	1
God	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
Alma	1
4214	1
14	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
mankind	1
were	1
fallen	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
justice	1
yea	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
consigned	1
them	1
forever	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
Alma	1
4215	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
mercy	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
about	1
except	1
an	1
atonement	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
therefore	1
God	1
himself	1
atoneth	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
mercy	1
to	1
appease	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
justice	1
that	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
perfect	1
just	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
merciful	1
God	1
also	1
Alma	1
4216	1
16	1
Now	1
repentance	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
men	1
except	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
punishment	1
which	1
also	1
was	1
eternal	1
as	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
should	1
be	1
affixed	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
eternal	1
also	1
as	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
Alma	1
4217	1
17	1
Now	1
how	1
could	1
a	1
man	1
repent	1
except	1
he	1
should	1
sin	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
sin	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1
How	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
law	1
save	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
punishment	1
Alma	1
4218	1
18	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
punishment	1

a	1

which	1

Now	1

4220	1
20	1
And	1
also	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1
given	1
against	1
sin	1
men	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
sin	1
Alma	1
4221	1
21	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
law	1

if	1
men	1
sinned	1
what	1
could	1
justice	1

or	1
mercy	1
either	1

they	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
claim	1
upon	1
the	1
creature	1
Alma	1
4222	1
22	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
and	1
a	1
punishment	1
affixed	1
and	1
a	1
repentance	1
granted	1
which	1
repentance	1
mercy	1
claimeth	1
otherwise	1
justice	1
claimeth	1
the	1

executeth	1

and	1
the	1
law	1
inflicteth	1
the	1
punishment	1
if	1
not	1
so	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
justice	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
God	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
Alma	1
4223	1
23	1
But	1
God	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
and	1
mercy	1
claimeth	1
the	1
penitent	1
and	1
mercy	1
cometh	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
atonement	1
and	1
the	1
atonement	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
bringeth	1
back	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
are	1
restored	1
into	1
his	1
presence	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
justice	1
Alma	1
4224	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
justice	1
exerciseth	1
all	1
his	1
demands	1
and	1
also	1
mercy	1
claimeth	1
all	1
which	1
is	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
thus	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
truly	1
penitent	1
are	1
saved	1
Alma	1
4225	1
25	1
What	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
mercy	1
can	1
rob	1
justice	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
not	1
one	1
whit	1
If	1
so	1
God	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
Alma	1
4226	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
God	1
bringeth	1
about	1
his	1
great	1
and	1
eternal	1
purposes	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
And	1
thus	1
cometh	1
about	1
the	1
salvation	1
and	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
destruction	1
and	1
misery	1
Alma	1
4227	1
27	1
Therefore	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
whosoever	1
will	1
come	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
life	1
freely	1
and	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
not	1
compelled	1
to	1
come	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
deeds	1
Alma	1
4228	1
28	1
If	1
he	1
has	1
desired	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
repented	1
in	1
his	1
days	1
behold	1
evil	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
4229	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
let	1
these	1
things	1
trouble	1
you	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
only	1
let	1
your	1
sins	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
that	1
trouble	1
which	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
down	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Alma	1
4230	1
30	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
deny	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
no	1
more	1
Do	1
not	1
endeavor	1
to	1
excuse	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
point	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
by	1
denying	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
let	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
longsuffering	1
have	1
full	1
sway	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
bring	1
you	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
in	1
humility	1
Alma	1
4231	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
souls	1
unto	1
repentance	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
mercy	1
may	1
have	1
claim	1
upon	1
them	1
And	1
may	1
God	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
Amen	1
Alma	1
43	1
Chapter	1
43	1
Alma	1
431	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Alma	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
Alma	1
also	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
rest	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
went	1
forth	1
Alma	1
432	1
2	1
Now	1
we	1
shall	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
concerning	1
their	1
preaching	1
except	1
that	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
revelation	1
and	1
they	1
preached	1
after	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
Alma	1
433	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
434	1
4	1
For	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
became	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
coming	1
upon	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
made	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
yea	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
their	1
armies	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
Alma	1
435	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
with	1
their	1
thousands	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Antionum	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Zerahemnah	1
was	1
their	1
leader	1
Alma	1
436	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
wicked	1
and	1
murderous	1
disposition	1
than	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
in	1
and	1
of	1
themselves	1
therefore	1
Zerahemnah	1
appointed	1
chief	1
captains	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
Zoramites	1
Alma	1
437	1
7	1
Now	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
preserve	1
their	1
hatred	1
towards	1
the	1
Nephites	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
subjection	1
to	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
his	1
designs	1
Alma	1
438	1
8	1
For	1
behold	1
his	1
designs	1
were	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
usurp	1
great	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
gain	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
by	1
bringing	1
them	1
into	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
439	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
was	1
to	1
support	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
preserve	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
preserve	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
their	1
privileges	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
liberty	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
worship	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
Alma	1
4310	1
10	1
For	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
whosoever	1
should	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
would	1
destroy	1
Alma	1
4311	1
11	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
knew	1
the	1
extreme	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
towards	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
AntiNephiLehi	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammonand	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
yea	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
break	1
ittherefore	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Alma	1
4312	1
12	1
And	1
the	1
Nephites	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
therefore	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
lands	1
for	1
their	1
inheritance	1
Alma	1
4313	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
a	1
large	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
substance	1
to	1
support	1
their	1
armies	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
compelled	1
alone	1
to	1
withstand	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
a	1
compound	1
of	1
Laman	1
and	1
Lemuel	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
dissented	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
the	1
descendants	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Noah	1
Alma	1
4314	1
14	1
Now	1
those	1
descendants	1
were	1
as	1
numerous	1
nearly	1
as	1
were	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
even	1
unto	1
bloodshed	1
Alma	1
4315	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Antionum	1
behold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
Alma	1
4316	1
16	1
Now	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
or	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
Nephitesnow	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
took	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephitesand	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
4317	1
17	1
And	1
Moroni	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
command	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
their	1
wars	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
appointed	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4318	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Jershon	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
armed	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
cimeters	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
4319	1
19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
or	1
that	1
Moroni	1
had	1
prepared	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
breastplates	1
and	1
with	1
armshields	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
shields	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
dressed	1
with	1
thick	1
clothing	1
Alma	1
4320	1
20	1
Now	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Zerahemnah	1
was	1
not	1
prepared	1
with	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
they	1
had	1
only	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
their	1
cimeters	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
their	1
arrows	1
their	1
stones	1
and	1
their	1
slings	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
naked	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
skin	1
which	1
was	1
girded	1
about	1
their	1
loins	1
yea	1
all	1
were	1
naked	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
Alma	1
4321	1
21	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
armed	1
with	1
breastplates	1
nor	1
shieldstherefore	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
armor	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
number	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4322	1
22	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Jershon	1
therefore	1
they	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Antionum	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moroni	1
would	1
know	1
whither	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
Alma	1
4323	1
23	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Moroni	1
sent	1
spies	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
watch	1
their	1
camp	1
and	1
Moroni	1
also	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Alma	1
sent	1
certain	1
men	1
unto	1
him	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
whither	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4324	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
Alma	1
and	1
Alma	1
informed	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Moroni	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
marching	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
commence	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
weaker	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
those	1
messengers	1
went	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
message	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
4325	1
25	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
leaving	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jershon	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
that	1
land	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
took	1
the	1
remaining	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
marched	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
4326	1
26	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
country	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
their	1
liberties	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4327	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
army	1
should	1
be	1
secreted	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
4328	1
28	1
And	1
Moroni	1
placed	1
spies	1
round	1
about	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
when	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
Alma	1
4329	1
29	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
Moroni	1
knew	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
intention	1
to	1
destroy	1
their	1
brethren	1
or	1
to	1
subject	1
them	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
establish	1
a	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
themselves	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
4330	1
30	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
preserve	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
liberty	1
and	1
their	1
church	1
therefore	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
no	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
defend	1
them	1
by	1
stratagem	1
therefore	1
he	1
found	1
by	1
his	1
spies	1
which	1
course	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
Alma	1
4331	1
31	1
Therefore	1
he	1
divided	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
part	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
concealed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
Riplah	1
Alma	1
4332	1
32	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
he	1
concealed	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
valley	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
and	1
so	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
4333	1
33	1
And	1
thus	1
having	1
placed	1
his	1
army	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desire	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
Alma	1
4334	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
where	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
was	1
concealed	1
Alma	1
4335	1
35	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
hill	1
Riplah	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
was	1
concealed	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
which	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Lehi	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
his	1
army	1
forth	1
and	1
encircled	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
Alma	1
4336	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
Nephites	1
coming	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
turned	1
them	1
about	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Lehi	1
Alma	1
4337	1
37	1
And	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
death	1
commenced	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
dreadful	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
their	1
nakedness	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
heavy	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
their	1
cimeters	1
which	1
brought	1
death	1
almost	1
at	1
every	1
stroke	1
Alma	1
4338	1
38	1
While	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
man	1
fell	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
by	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
they	1
being	1
shielded	1
from	1
the	1
more	1
vital	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
or	1
the	1
more	1
vital	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
being	1
shielded	1
from	1
the	1
strokes	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
by	1
their	1
breastplates	1
and	1
their	1
armshields	1
and	1
their	1
headplates	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
death	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4339	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
became	1
frightened	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
destruction	1
among	1
them	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
towards	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
4340	1
40	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
pursued	1
by	1
Lehi	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
by	1
Lehi	1
into	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
and	1
they	1
crossed	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
And	1
Lehi	1
retained	1
his	1
armies	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
cross	1
Alma	1
4341	1
41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
met	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
4342	1
42	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
flee	1
again	1
before	1
them	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
4343	1
43	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
fight	1
exceedingly	1
yea	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
such	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
strength	1
and	1
courage	1
no	1
not	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Alma	1
4344	1
44	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
inspired	1
by	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
who	1
were	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
and	1
leaders	1
and	1
by	1
Zerahemnah	1
who	1
was	1
their	1
chief	1
captain	1
or	1
their	1
chief	1
leader	1
and	1
commander	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
fight	1
like	1
dragons	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
their	1
hands	1
yea	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
smite	1
in	1
two	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
headplates	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
pierce	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
breastplates	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
smite	1
off	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
smite	1
in	1
their	1
fierce	1
anger	1
Alma	1
4345	1
45	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
inspired	1
by	1
a	1
better	1
cause	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
fighting	1
for	1
monarchy	1
nor	1
power	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
fighting	1
for	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
their	1
liberties	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
all	1
yea	1
for	1
their	1
rites	1
of	1
worship	1
and	1
their	1
church	1
Alma	1
4346	1
46	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
felt	1
was	1
the	1
duty	1
which	1
they	1
owed	1
to	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
offense	1
neither	1
the	1
second	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
4347	1
47	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
Ye	1
shall	1
defend	1
your	1
families	1
even	1
unto	1
bloodshed	1
Therefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
were	1
the	1
Nephites	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
and	1
their	1
lands	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
their	1
religion	1
Alma	1
4348	1
48	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Moroni	1
saw	1
the	1
fierceness	1
and	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
shrink	1
and	1
flee	1
from	1
them	1
And	1
Moroni	1
perceiving	1
their	1
intent	1
sent	1
forth	1
and	1
inspired	1
their	1
hearts	1
with	1
these	1
thoughtsyea	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
their	1
liberty	1
yea	1
their	1
freedom	1
from	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
4349	1
49	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
their	1
liberty	1
and	1
their	1
freedom	1
from	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
4350	1
50	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
selfsame	1
hour	1
that	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
their	1
freedom	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
4351	1
51	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
more	1
numerous	1
yea	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
double	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
4352	1
52	1
Therefore	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moroni	1
encircled	1
them	1
about	1
yea	1
even	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
for	1
behold	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
were	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Lehi	1
Alma	1
4353	1
53	1
Therefore	1
when	1
Zerahemnah	1
saw	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Lehi	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moroni	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
they	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
terror	1
Alma	1
4354	1
54	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
their	1
terror	1
commanded	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
stop	1
shedding	1
their	1
blood	1
Alma	1
44	1
Chapter	1
44	1
Alma	1
441	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
stop	1
and	1
withdrew	1
a	1
pace	1
from	1
them	1
And	1
Moroni	1
said	1
unto	1
Zerahemnah	1
Behold	1
Zerahemnah	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
of	1
blood	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
yet	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
slay	1
you	1
Alma	1
442	1
2	1
Behold	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
you	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
shed	1
your	1
blood	1
for	1
power	1
neither	1
do	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
bring	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
cause	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
come	1
against	1
us	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
Alma	1
443	1
3	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
behold	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
ye	1
behold	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
delivered	1
you	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
unto	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
and	1
our	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
destroy	1
this	1
our	1
faith	1
Alma	1
444	1
4	1
Now	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
faith	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
support	1
and	1
keep	1
and	1
preserve	1
us	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
faithful	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
unto	1
our	1
faith	1
and	1
our	1
religion	1
and	1
never	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
except	1
we	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
and	1
deny	1
our	1
faith	1
Alma	1
445	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
Zerahemnah	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
allpowerful	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
strengthened	1
our	1
arms	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
gained	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
faith	1
by	1
our	1
religion	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
rites	1
of	1
worship	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
church	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sacred	1
support	1
which	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
by	1
that	1
liberty	1
which	1
binds	1
us	1
to	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
our	1
country	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
sacred	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
owe	1
all	1
our	1
happiness	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
most	1
dear	1
unto	1
us	1
Alma	1
446	1
6	1
Yea	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
desires	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
for	1
life	1
that	1
ye	1
deliver	1
up	1
your	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
seek	1
not	1
your	1
blood	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
spare	1
your	1
lives	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
go	1
your	1
way	1
and	1
come	1
not	1
again	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
us	1
Alma	1
447	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
command	1
my	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
inflict	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
your	1
bodies	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
become	1
extinct	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
448	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Zerahemnah	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
sayings	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
delivered	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
his	1
cimeter	1
and	1
his	1
bow	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Behold	1
here	1
are	1
our	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
we	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
ourselves	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
oath	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
break	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
children	1
but	1
take	1
our	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
otherwise	1
we	1
will	1
retain	1
our	1
swords	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
perish	1
or	1
conquer	1
Alma	1
449	1
9	1
Behold	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
has	1
delivered	1
us	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
but	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
cunning	1
that	1
has	1
preserved	1
you	1
from	1
our	1
swords	1
Behold	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
breastplates	1
and	1
your	1
shields	1
that	1
have	1
preserved	1
you	1
Alma	1
4410	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Zerahemnah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
Moroni	1
returned	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
unto	1
Zerahemnah	1
saying	1
Behold	1
we	1
will	1
end	1
the	1
conflict	1
Alma	1
4411	1
11	1
Now	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
therefore	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
except	1
ye	1
depart	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
again	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
war	1
Now	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
we	1
will	1
spill	1
your	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
or	1
ye	1
shall	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
conditions	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
proposed	1
Alma	1
4412	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
Zerahemnah	1
retained	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
Moroni	1
and	1
he	1
rushed	1
forward	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
slay	1
Moroni	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
sword	1
behold	1
one	1
of	1
Moronis	1
soldiers	1
smote	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
it	1
broke	1
by	1
the	1
hilt	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
smote	1
Zerahemnah	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
scalp	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
Zerahemnah	1
withdrew	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
soldiers	1
Alma	1
4413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
who	1
smote	1
off	1
the	1
scalp	1
of	1
Zerahemnah	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
scalp	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
hair	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
stretched	1
it	1
forth	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
Alma	1
4414	1
14	1
Even	1
as	1
this	1
scalp	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
scalp	1
of	1
your	1
chief	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
except	1
ye	1
will	1
deliver	1
up	1
your	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
depart	1
with	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
peace	1
Alma	1
4415	1
15	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
scalp	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
sword	1
that	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
many	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
peace	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
they	1
suffered	1
to	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
4416	1
16	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zerahemnah	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
soldiers	1
to	1
anger	1
to	1
contend	1
more	1
powerfully	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4417	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
Moroni	1
was	1
angry	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
stubbornness	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
he	1
commanded	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
contend	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
their	1
might	1
Alma	1
4418	1
18	1
But	1
behold	1
their	1
naked	1
skins	1
and	1
their	1
bare	1
heads	1
were	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
sharp	1
swords	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
yea	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
pierced	1
and	1
smitten	1
yea	1
and	1
did	1
fall	1
exceedingly	1
fast	1
before	1
the	1
swords	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
swept	1
down	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
soldier	1
of	1
Moroni	1
had	1
prophesied	1
Alma	1
4419	1
19	1
Now	1
Zerahemnah	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
cried	1
mightily	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
promising	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
covenant	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
spare	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
war	1
again	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
4420	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
death	1
should	1
cease	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
from	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
peace	1
they	1
were	1
suffered	1
to	1
depart	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
4421	1
21	1
Now	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
was	1
not	1
numbered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
yea	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4422	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
their	1
dead	1
into	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
forth	1
and	1
are	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
Alma	1
4423	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
or	1
of	1
Moroni	1
returned	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
their	1
lands	1
Alma	1
4424	1
24	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
Alma	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
45	1
Chapter	1
45	1
Alma	1
451	1
1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
rejoiced	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
again	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
therefore	1
they	1
gave	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
fast	1
much	1
and	1
pray	1
much	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
worship	1
God	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
Alma	1
452	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
Alma	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
son	1
Helaman	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee	1
concerning	1
those	1
records	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
Alma	1
453	1
3	1
And	1
Helaman	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
Alma	1
454	1
4	1
And	1
Alma	1
said	1
again	1
Believest	1
thou	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
shall	1
come	1
Alma	1
455	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
Alma	1
456	1
6	1
And	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
Will	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
Alma	1
457	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
thy	1
commandments	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
Alma	1
458	1
8	1
Then	1
Alma	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
prosper	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
Alma	1
459	1
9	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
yea	1
what	1
I	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
prophecy	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
therefore	1
write	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
Alma	1
4510	1
10	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
Behold	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
very	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
me	1
in	1
four	1
hundred	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
shall	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
shall	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
Alma	1
4511	1
11	1
Yea	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
wars	1
and	1
pestilences	1
yea	1
famines	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
shall	1
become	1
extinct	1
Alma	1
4512	1
12	1
Yea	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
they	1
shall	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquities	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
because	1
they	1
shall	1
sin	1
against	1
so	1
great	1
light	1
and	1
knowledge	1
yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
even	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
all	1
pass	1
away	1
before	1
this	1
great	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
come	1
Alma	1
4513	1
13	1
And	1
when	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
cometh	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
very	1
soon	1
cometh	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
or	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
4514	1
14	1
But	1
whosoever	1
remaineth	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
destroyed	1
in	1
that	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
shall	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
them	1
shall	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
pursue	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
extinct	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
this	1
prophecy	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Alma	1
4515	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
Helaman	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
other	1
sons	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
blessed	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
sake	1
Alma	1
4516	1
16	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GodCursed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
every	1
nation	1
kindred	1
tongue	1
and	1
people	1
unto	1
destruction	1
which	1
do	1
wickedly	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
cursing	1
and	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
cannot	1
look	1
upon	1
sin	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
degree	1
of	1
allowance	1
Alma	1
4517	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
blessed	1
the	1
church	1
yea	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
should	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
henceforth	1
Alma	1
4518	1
18	1
And	1
when	1
Alma	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Melek	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
more	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
death	1
or	1
burial	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
of	1
Alma	1
4519	1
19	1
Behold	1
this	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
saying	1
went	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
or	1
buried	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
even	1
as	1
Moses	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
scriptures	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
took	1
Moses	1
unto	1
himself	1
and	1
we	1
suppose	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
received	1
Alma	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
unto	1
himself	1
therefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
we	1
know	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
burial	1
Alma	1
4520	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
that	1
Helaman	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them	1
Alma	1
4521	1
21	1
For	1
behold	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wars	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
little	1
dissensions	1
and	1
disturbances	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
declared	1
among	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
regulation	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
throughout	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
4522	1
22	1
Therefore	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
church	1
again	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
appoint	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
Alma	1
4523	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
had	1
appointed	1
priests	1
and	1
teachers	1
over	1
the	1
churches	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
dissension	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
4524	1
24	1
But	1
they	1
grew	1
proud	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
riches	1
therefore	1
they	1
grew	1
rich	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
their	1
words	1
to	1
walk	1
uprightly	1
before	1
God	1
Alma	1
46	1
Chapter	1
46	1
Alma	1
461	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
462	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
463	1
3	1
Now	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
wroth	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Amalickiah	1
Alma	1
464	1
4	1
And	1
Amalickiah	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
wroth	1
were	1
also	1
desirous	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
lower	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
seeking	1
for	1
power	1
Alma	1
465	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
flatteries	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
support	1
him	1
and	1
establish	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
rulers	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
466	1
6	1
Thus	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
Amalickiah	1
to	1
dissensions	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
yea	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
care	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
high	1
priests	1
over	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
467	1
7	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
flattering	1
words	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
therefore	1
they	1
dissented	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
exceedingly	1
precarious	1
and	1
dangerous	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
great	1
victory	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
rejoicings	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
deliverance	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
468	1
8	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
how	1
quick	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
do	1
forget	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
how	1
quick	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
evil	1
one	1
Alma	1
469	1
9	1
Yea	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
wickedness	1
one	1
very	1
wicked	1
man	1
can	1
cause	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
4610	1
10	1
Yea	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
cunning	1
device	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
many	1
flattering	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
led	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
wickedly	1
yea	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
liberty	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
or	1
which	1
blessing	1
God	1
had	1
sent	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
sake	1
Alma	1
4611	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
these	1
dissensions	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
Amalickiah	1
Alma	1
4612	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
piece	1
thereof	1
and	1
wrote	1
upon	1
itIn	1
memory	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
our	1
religion	1
and	1
freedom	1
and	1
our	1
peace	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
childrenand	1
he	1
fastened	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
pole	1
Alma	1
4613	1
13	1
And	1
he	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
headplate	1
and	1
his	1
breastplate	1
and	1
his	1
shields	1
and	1
girded	1
on	1
his	1
armor	1
about	1
his	1
loins	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pole	1
which	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
his	1
rent	1
coat	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
mightily	1
unto	1
his	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
liberty	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
his	1
brethren	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
should	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
Christians	1
remain	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
4614	1
14	1
For	1
thus	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
true	1
believers	1
of	1
Christ	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
called	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
4615	1
15	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
were	1
faithful	1
yea	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
true	1
believers	1
in	1
Christ	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
gladly	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
or	1
Christians	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
Christ	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
Alma	1
4616	1
16	1
And	1
therefore	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
Moroni	1
prayed	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
might	1
be	1
favored	1
Alma	1
4617	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
to	1
God	1
he	1
named	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
southA	1
chosen	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
liberty	1
Alma	1
4618	1
18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Surely	1
God	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
despised	1
because	1
we	1
take	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
and	1
destroyed	1
until	1
we	1
bring	1
it	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
transgressions	1
Alma	1
4619	1
19	1
And	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
waving	1
the	1
rent	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
garment	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
that	1
all	1
might	1
see	1
the	1
writing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
rent	1
part	1
and	1
crying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
Alma	1
4620	1
20	1
Behold	1
whosoever	1
will	1
maintain	1
this	1
title	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
maintain	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
their	1
religion	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
may	1
bless	1
them	1
Alma	1
4621	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
proclaimed	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
running	1
together	1
with	1
their	1
armor	1
girded	1
about	1
their	1
loins	1
rending	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
token	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
forsake	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
rend	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
rent	1
their	1
garments	1
Alma	1
4622	1
22	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
they	1
made	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Moroni	1
saying	1
We	1
covenant	1
with	1
our	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
yea	1
he	1
may	1
cast	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
cast	1
our	1
garments	1
at	1
thy	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
Alma	1
4623	1
23	1
Moroni	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob	1
yea	1
we	1
are	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
whose	1
coat	1
was	1
rent	1
by	1
his	1
brethren	1
into	1
many	1
pieces	1
yea	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
let	1
us	1
remember	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
our	1
garments	1
shall	1
be	1
rent	1
by	1
our	1
brethren	1
and	1
we	1
be	1
cast	1

Yea	1
let	1
us	1
preserve	1
our	1
liberty	1
as	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
Joseph	1
yea	1
let	1
us	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jacob	1
before	1
his	1
death	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
of	1
Joseph	1
was	1
preserved	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
decayed	1
And	1
he	1
saidEven	1
as	1
this	1
remnant	1
of	1
garment	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
hath	1
been	1
preserved	1
so	1
shall	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
be	1
preserved	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
taken	1
unto	1
himself	1
while	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
perish	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
garment	1
Alma	1
4625	1
25	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
giveth	1
my	1
soul	1
sorrow	1
nevertheless	1
my	1
soul	1
hath	1
joy	1
in	1
my	1
son	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
unto	1
God	1
Alma	1
4626	1
26	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Jacob	1
Alma	1
4627	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
who	1
knoweth	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
which	1
shall	1
perish	1
as	1
his	1
garment	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
dissented	1
from	1
us	1
Yea	1
and	1
even	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
ourselves	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ	1
Alma	1
4628	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
also	1
sent	1
forth	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
dissensions	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
maintain	1
their	1
liberty	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
Amalickiah	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
dissented	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
Amalickiahites	1
Alma	1
4629	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Amalickiah	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Moroni	1
were	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
the	1
Amalickiahitesand	1
he	1
also	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
doubtful	1
concerning	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
undertakentherefore	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
gain	1
the	1
point	1
he	1
took	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
4630	1
30	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
strength	1
therefore	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
or	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
back	1
and	1
put	1
Amalickiah	1
to	1
death	1
yea	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
would	1
do	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
obtain	1
his	1
purposes	1
Alma	1
4631	1
31	1
Therefore	1
Moroni	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
armies	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
armed	1
themselves	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peaceand	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
marched	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
tents	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
4632	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desires	1
and	1
marched	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
headed	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
Alma	1
4633	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
fled	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
were	1
delivered	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
were	1
taken	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
4634	1
34	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
chief	1
judges	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
with	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
establish	1
and	1
to	1
exercise	1
authority	1
over	1
them	1
Alma	1
4635	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whomsoever	1
of	1
the	1
Amalickiahites	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
freedom	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
maintain	1
a	1
free	1
government	1
he	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
who	1
denied	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
freedom	1
Alma	1
4636	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
hoisted	1
upon	1
every	1
tower	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
thus	1
Moroni	1
planted	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
liberty	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4637	1
37	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
peace	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
maintain	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
until	1
nearly	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
4638	1
38	1
And	1
Helaman	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priests	1
did	1
also	1
maintain	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
yea	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
did	1
they	1
have	1
much	1
peace	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
4639	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
died	1
firmly	1
believing	1
that	1
their	1
souls	1
were	1
redeemed	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
thus	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
rejoicing	1
Alma	1
4640	1
40	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
who	1
died	1
with	1
fevers	1
which	1
at	1
some	1
seasons	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
were	1
very	1
frequent	1
in	1
the	1
landbut	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
with	1
fevers	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
excellent	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
plants	1
and	1
roots	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
prepared	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
diseases	1
to	1
which	1
men	1
were	1
subject	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
climate	1
Alma	1
4641	1
41	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
died	1
with	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ	1
are	1
happy	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
we	1
must	1
needs	1
suppose	1
Alma	1
47	1
Chapter	1
47	1
Alma	1
471	1
1	1
Now	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
in	1
our	1
record	1
to	1
Amalickiah	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
those	1
who	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
his	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
again	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
472	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
proclamation	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
afraid	1
yea	1
they	1
feared	1
to	1
displease	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
feared	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
lose	1
their	1
lives	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
or	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
473	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
wroth	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
disobedience	1
therefore	1
he	1
gave	1
Amalickiah	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
which	1
was	1
obedient	1
unto	1
his	1
commands	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
arms	1
Alma	1
474	1
4	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
for	1
he	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
subtle	1
man	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
therefore	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
plan	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
dethrone	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
475	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
gain	1
favor	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
obedient	1
therefore	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Onidah	1
for	1
thither	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
fled	1
for	1
they	1
discovered	1
the	1
army	1
coming	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
coming	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
fled	1
to	1
Onidah	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
arms	1
Alma	1
476	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
leader	1
over	1
them	1
being	1
fixed	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
resolution	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
477	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Antipas	1
in	1
preparation	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
478	1
8	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Amalickiahs	1
intention	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
battle	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
but	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
gain	1
favor	1
with	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
place	1
himself	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
and	1
dethrone	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Alma	1
479	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
mount	1
Antipas	1
Alma	1
4710	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
secret	1
embassy	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
Antipas	1
desiring	1
that	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Lehonti	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
for	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
Alma	1
4711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Lehonti	1
received	1
the	1
message	1
he	1
durst	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
sent	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
desiring	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lehonti	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
Alma	1
4712	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Amalickiah	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
Lehonti	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
nearly	1
to	1
Lehontis	1
camp	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
again	1
the	1
fourth	1
time	1
his	1
message	1
unto	1
Lehonti	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
guards	1
with	1
him	1
Alma	1
4713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Lehonti	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
guards	1
to	1
Amalickiah	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
and	1
surround	1
those	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
camps	1
over	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
command	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
Lehontis	1
hands	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
Amalickiah	1
a	1
second	1
leader	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
Alma	1
4714	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lehonti	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
surrounded	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
so	1
that	1
before	1
they	1
awoke	1
at	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
day	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Lehonti	1
Alma	1
4715	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
they	1
plead	1
with	1
Amalickiah	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
which	1
Amalickiah	1
desired	1
Alma	1
4716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
delivered	1
his	1
men	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
desired	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
accomplish	1
his	1
designs	1
in	1
dethroning	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
4717	1
17	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
if	1
their	1
chief	1
leader	1
was	1
killed	1
to	1
appoint	1
the	1
second	1
leader	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
chief	1
leader	1
Alma	1
4718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
caused	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
should	1
administer	1
poison	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
Lehonti	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
Alma	1
4719	1
19	1
Now	1
when	1
Lehonti	1
was	1
dead	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
appointed	1
Amalickiah	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
leader	1
and	1
their	1
chief	1
commander	1
Alma	1
4720	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
marched	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
desires	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephi	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
city	1
Alma	1
4721	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
guards	1
for	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
commands	1
and	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
so	1
great	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
4722	1
22	1
But	1
behold	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
Amalickiah	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
reverence	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
greatness	1
Alma	1
4723	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
raise	1
them	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
as	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
peace	1
which	1
custom	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4724	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
the	1
first	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
behold	1
he	1
stabbed	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
4725	1
25	1
Now	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
fled	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
raised	1
a	1
cry	1
saying	1
Alma	1
4726	1
26	1
Behold	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
have	1
stabbed	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
fallen	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
fled	1
behold	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
Alma	1
4727	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
commanded	1
that	1
his	1
armies	1
should	1
march	1
forth	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
king	1
lying	1
in	1
his	1
gore	1
Amalickiah	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
wroth	1
and	1
said	1
Whosoever	1
loved	1
the	1
king	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
pursue	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
slain	1
Alma	1
4728	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
king	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
4729	1
29	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
an	1
army	1
pursuing	1
after	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
frightened	1
again	1
and	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
Alma	1
4730	1
30	1
And	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
pursued	1
after	1
them	1
returned	1
having	1
pursued	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
thus	1
Amalickiah	1
by	1
his	1
fraud	1
gained	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
4731	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
city	1
Nephi	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
4732	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
queen	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
slainfor	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
sent	1
an	1
embassy	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
informing	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
pursued	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
escape	1
Alma	1
4733	1
33	1
Therefore	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
had	1
received	1
this	1
message	1
she	1
sent	1
unto	1
Amalickiah	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
spare	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
she	1
also	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
also	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
witnesses	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
testify	1
concerning	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
4734	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
took	1
the	1
same	1
servant	1
that	1
slew	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
them	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
sat	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
testified	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
servants	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
also	1
They	1
have	1
fled	1
does	1
not	1
this	1
testify	1
against	1
them	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
satisfied	1
the	1
queen	1
concerning	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Alma	1
4735	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
sought	1
the	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
wife	1
and	1
thus	1
by	1
his	1
fraud	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
cunning	1
servants	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
kingdom	1
yea	1
he	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
king	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Lemuelites	1
and	1
the	1
Ishmaelites	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
dissenters	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
from	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Nephi	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
Alma	1
4736	1
36	1
Now	1
these	1
dissenters	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
instruction	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
information	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
yea	1
having	1
been	1
instructed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
is	1
strange	1
to	1
relate	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
their	1
dissensions	1
they	1
became	1
more	1
hardened	1
and	1
impenitent	1
and	1
more	1
wild	1
wicked	1
and	1
ferocious	1
than	1
the	1
Lamanitesdrinking	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
indolence	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
lasciviousness	1
yea	1
entirely	1
forgetting	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
48	1
Chapter	1
48	1
Alma	1
481	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
kingdom	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
appoint	1
men	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
from	1
their	1
towers	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
482	1
2	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
inspire	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
he	1
having	1
accomplished	1
his	1
designs	1
thus	1
far	1
yea	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
he	1
sought	1
also	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
the	1
Nephites	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
483	1
3	1
Therefore	1
he	1
had	1
accomplished	1
his	1
design	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
hardened	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
blinded	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
stirred	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
a	1
numerous	1
host	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
484	1
4	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
overpower	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
485	1
5	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
appoint	1
chief	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
they	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
their	1
places	1
of	1
resort	1
and	1
the	1
weakest	1
parts	1
of	1
their	1
cities	1
therefore	1
he	1
appointed	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
chief	1
captains	1
over	1
his	1
armies	1
Alma	1
486	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
camp	1
and	1
moved	1
forth	1
toward	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
487	1
7	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
thus	1
been	1
obtaining	1
power	1
by	1
fraud	1
and	1
deceit	1
Moroni	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
had	1
been	1
preparing	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
488	1
8	1
Yea	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
strengthening	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
erecting	1
small	1
forts	1
or	1
places	1
of	1
resort	1
throwing	1
up	1
banks	1
of	1
earth	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
enclose	1
his	1
armies	1
and	1
also	1
building	1
walls	1
of	1
stone	1
to	1
encircle	1
them	1
about	1
round	1
about	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
yea	1
all	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
489	1
9	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
weakest	1
fortifications	1
he	1
did	1
place	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
fortify	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4810	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
support	1
their	1
liberty	1
their	1
lands	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
peace	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
live	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
maintain	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
by	1
their	1
enemies	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Christians	1
Alma	1
4811	1
11	1
And	1
Moroni	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
perfect	1
understanding	1
yea	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
delight	1
in	1
bloodshed	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
soul	1
did	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
liberty	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
from	1
bondage	1
and	1
slavery	1
Alma	1
4812	1
12	1
Yea	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
heart	1
did	1
swell	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
his	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
many	1
privileges	1
and	1
blessings	1
which	1
he	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
his	1
people	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
labor	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
safety	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
4813	1
13	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
defend	1
his	1
people	1
his	1
rights	1
and	1
his	1
country	1
and	1
his	1
religion	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
blood	1
Alma	1
4814	1
14	1
Now	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
taught	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
necessary	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
taught	1
never	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
offense	1
yea	1
and	1
never	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
sword	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
against	1
an	1
enemy	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
preserve	1
their	1
lives	1
Alma	1
4815	1
15	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
their	1
faith	1
that	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
God	1
would	1
prosper	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
prosper	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
warn	1
them	1
to	1
flee	1
or	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
war	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
danger	1
Alma	1
4816	1
16	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
whither	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
did	1
glory	1
in	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
but	1
in	1
doing	1
good	1
in	1
preserving	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
resisting	1
iniquity	1
Alma	1
4817	1
17	1
Yea	1
verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
all	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
were	1
and	1
ever	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
behold	1
the	1
very	1
powers	1
of	1
hell	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
shaken	1
forever	1
yea	1
the	1
devil	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
4818	1
18	1
Behold	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
unto	1
Ammon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
other	1
sons	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
4819	1
19	1
Now	1
behold	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
no	1
less	1
serviceable	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
than	1
was	1
Moroni	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
baptize	1
unto	1
repentance	1
all	1
men	1
whosoever	1
would	1
hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
words	1
Alma	1
4820	1
20	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
words	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
highly	1
favored	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
among	1
themselves	1
yea	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
Alma	1
4821	1
21	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
yea	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
peace	1
amongst	1
themselves	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
reluctantly	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4822	1
22	1
Yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
their	1
wars	1
never	1
did	1
cease	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
much	1
reluctance	1
Alma	1
4823	1
23	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
sorry	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
yea	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
allthey	1
were	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
sending	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
into	1
an	1
eternal	1
world	1
unprepared	1
to	1
meet	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
4824	1
24	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
suffer	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
lives	1
that	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
massacred	1
by	1
the	1
barbarous	1
cruelty	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
their	1
brethren	1
yea	1
and	1
had	1
dissented	1
from	1
their	1
church	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
by	1
joining	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4825	1
25	1
Yea	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
that	1
their	1
brethren	1
should	1
rejoice	1
over	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
who	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
they	1
should	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
491	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
seen	1
approaching	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
Alma	1
492	1
2	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
been	1
rebuilt	1
and	1
Moroni	1
had	1
stationed	1
an	1
army	1
by	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
up	1
dirt	1
around	1
about	1
to	1
shield	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
arrows	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
fought	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
with	1
arrows	1
Alma	1
493	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
had	1
been	1
rebuilt	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
part	1
rebuilt	1
and	1
because	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
destroyed	1
it	1
once	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
again	1
become	1
an	1
easy	1
prey	1
for	1
them	1
Alma	1
494	1
4	1
But	1
behold	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
their	1
disappointment	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
dug	1
up	1
a	1
ridge	1
of	1
earth	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
high	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
cast	1
their	1
stones	1
and	1
their	1
arrows	1
at	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
effect	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
save	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
their	1
place	1
of	1
entrance	1
Alma	1
495	1
5	1
Now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
chief	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
preparing	1
their	1
places	1
of	1
security	1
Alma	1
496	1
6	1
Now	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
supposed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
numbers	1
yea	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
privileged	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
hitherto	1
done	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
with	1
shields	1
and	1
with	1
breastplates	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
with	1
garments	1
of	1
skins	1
yea	1
very	1
thick	1
garments	1
to	1
cover	1
their	1
nakedness	1
Alma	1
497	1
7	1
And	1
being	1
thus	1
prepared	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
easily	1
overpower	1
and	1
subject	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage	1
or	1
slay	1
and	1
massacre	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
pleasure	1
Alma	1
498	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
to	1
their	1
uttermost	1
astonishment	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lehi	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
battle	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
instructions	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
499	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
or	1
the	1
Amalickiahites	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
astonished	1
at	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
preparation	1
for	1
war	1
Alma	1
4910	1
10	1
Now	1
if	1
king	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
perhaps	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
have	1
attacked	1
the	1
Nephites	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
4911	1
11	1
But	1
behold	1
Amalickiah	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
himself	1
to	1
battle	1
And	1
behold	1
his	1
chief	1
captains	1
durst	1
not	1
attack	1
the	1
Nephites	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
for	1
Moroni	1
had	1
altered	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
affairs	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
disappointed	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
of	1
retreat	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
4912	1
12	1
Therefore	1
they	1
retreated	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
camp	1
and	1
marched	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Noah	1
supposing	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
best	1
place	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
4913	1
13	1
For	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Moroni	1
had	1
fortified	1
or	1
had	1
built	1
forts	1
of	1
security	1
for	1
every	1
city	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
therefore	1
they	1
marched	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Noah	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
determination	1
yea	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
Alma	1
4914	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
to	1
their	1
astonishment	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Noah	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
a	1
weak	1
place	1
had	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
Moroni	1
become	1
strong	1
yea	1
even	1
to	1
exceed	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Ammonihah	1
Alma	1
4915	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
wisdom	1
in	1
Moroni	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
Ammonihah	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Noah	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
the	1
weakest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
therefore	1
they	1
would	1
march	1
thither	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desires	1
Alma	1
4916	1
16	1
And	1
behold	1
Moroni	1
had	1
appointed	1
Lehi	1
to	1
be	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
same	1
Lehi	1
who	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidon	1
Alma	1
4917	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
Lehi	1
commanded	1
the	1
city	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
disappointed	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
Lehi	1
exceedingly	1
nevertheless	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
city	1
therefore	1
they	1
brought	1
up	1
their	1
armies	1
Alma	1
4918	1
18	1
Now	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
their	1
forts	1
of	1
security	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
save	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
highness	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dug	1
round	1
about	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
Alma	1
4919	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Nephites	1
prepared	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
climb	1
up	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
fort	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
by	1
casting	1
over	1
stones	1
and	1
arrows	1
at	1
them	1
Alma	1
4920	1
20	1
Thus	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
yea	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
their	1
strongest	1
men	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
their	1
slings	1
to	1
smite	1
down	1
all	1
who	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
their	1
place	1
of	1
security	1
by	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
entrance	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
they	1
prepared	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
4921	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
brought	1
up	1
their	1
armies	1
before	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
entrance	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
their	1
place	1
of	1
security	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
an	1
immense	1
slaughter	1
Alma	1
4922	1
22	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
obtain	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
by	1
the	1
pass	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
dig	1
down	1
their	1
banks	1
of	1
earth	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
pass	1
to	1
their	1
armies	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
chance	1
to	1
fight	1
but	1
behold	1
in	1
these	1
attempts	1
they	1
were	1
swept	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
arrows	1
which	1
were	1
thrown	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
filling	1
up	1
their	1
ditches	1
by	1
pulling	1
down	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
earth	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
measure	1
with	1
their	1
dead	1
and	1
wounded	1
bodies	1
Alma	1
4923	1
23	1
Thus	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
all	1
power	1
over	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
attempt	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
Nephites	1
until	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
were	1
all	1
slain	1
yea	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
slain	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
which	1
was	1
slain	1
Alma	1
4924	1
24	1
There	1
were	1
about	1
fifty	1
who	1
were	1
wounded	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
through	1
the	1
pass	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
shielded	1
by	1
their	1
shields	1
and	1
their	1
breastplates	1
and	1
their	1
headplates	1
insomuch	1
that	1
their	1
wounds	1
were	1
upon	1
their	1
legs	1
many	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
very	1
severe	1
Alma	1
4925	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
were	1
all	1
slain	1
they	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
to	1
inform	1
their	1
king	1
Amalickiah	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Nephite	1
by	1
birth	1
concerning	1
their	1
great	1
loss	1
Alma	1
4926	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
people	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
his	1
desire	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
subjected	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
4927	1
27	1
Yea	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
curse	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
Moroni	1
swearing	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
his	1
blood	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
Moroni	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Alma	1
4928	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
thank	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
matchless	1
power	1
in	1
delivering	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
4929	1
29	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
4930	1
30	1
Yea	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
prosperity	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
heed	1
and	1
diligence	1
which	1
they	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
Helaman	1
and	1
Shiblon	1
and	1
Corianton	1
and	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
yea	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ordained	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
being	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
50	1
Chapter	1
50	1
Alma	1
501	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
making	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
or	1
to	1
defend	1
his	1
people	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
armies	1
should	1
commence	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
commence	1
in	1
digging	1
up	1
heaps	1
of	1
earth	1
round	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
502	1
2	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
these	1
ridges	1
of	1
earth	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
timbers	1
yea	1
works	1
of	1
timbers	1
built	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
cities	1
Alma	1
503	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
upon	1
those	1
works	1
of	1
timbers	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
frame	1
of	1
pickets	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
timbers	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
strong	1
and	1
high	1
Alma	1
504	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
towers	1
to	1
be	1
erected	1
that	1
overlooked	1
those	1
works	1
of	1
pickets	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
places	1
of	1
security	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
upon	1
those	1
towers	1
that	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
hurt	1
them	1
Alma	1
505	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
cast	1
stones	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
pleasure	1
and	1
their	1
strength	1
and	1
slay	1
him	1
who	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
approach	1
near	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
506	1
6	1
Thus	1
Moroni	1
did	1
prepare	1
strongholds	1
against	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
round	1
about	1
every	1
city	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
507	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
armies	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
drove	1
all	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
which	1
were	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
508	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
sea	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
Alma	1
509	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
driven	1
all	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
possessions	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
5010	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
placed	1
armies	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
possessions	1
and	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
erect	1
fortifications	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
secure	1
their	1
armies	1
and	1
their	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
5011	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
strongholds	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
fortifying	1
the	1
line	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
between	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
running	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Sidonthe	1
Nephites	1
possessing	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
northward	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
pleasure	1
Alma	1
5012	1
12	1
Thus	1
Moroni	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
which	1
did	1
increase	1
daily	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
protection	1
which	1
his	1
works	1
did	1
bring	1
forth	1
unto	1
them	1
did	1
seek	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
possessions	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
upon	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
possession	1
Alma	1
5013	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
began	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Moroni	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
east	1
sea	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5014	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
began	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
a	1
city	1
between	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Aaron	1
joining	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Moroni	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
or	1
the	1
land	1
Nephihah	1
Alma	1
5015	1
15	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
began	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
to	1
build	1
many	1
cities	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
Lehi	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
by	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
5016	1
16	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
Alma	1
5017	1
17	1
And	1
in	1
these	1
prosperous	1
circumstances	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
5018	1
18	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
multiply	1
and	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
5019	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
how	1
merciful	1
and	1
just	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
dealings	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
yea	1
we	1
can	1
behold	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
verified	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Lehi	1
saying	1
Alma	1
5020	1
20	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
they	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
But	1
remember	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Alma	1
5021	1
21	1
And	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
these	1
promises	1
have	1
been	1
verified	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
their	1
quarrelings	1
and	1
their	1
contentions	1
yea	1
their	1
murderings	1
and	1
their	1
plunderings	1
their	1
idolatry	1
their	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
which	1
were	1
among	1
themselves	1
which	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
their	1
wars	1
and	1
their	1
destructions	1
Alma	1
5022	1
22	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
faithful	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
were	1
delivered	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
whilst	1
thousands	1
of	1
their	1
wicked	1
brethren	1
have	1
been	1
consigned	1
to	1
bondage	1
or	1
to	1
perish	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
or	1
to	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
mingle	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5023	1
23	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
happier	1
time	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Nephi	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Moroni	1
yea	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
5024	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
also	1
ended	1
in	1
peace	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
Alma	1
5025	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
would	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
peace	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
contention	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
among	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Morianton	1
which	1
joined	1
upon	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Lehi	1
both	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
5026	1
26	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
possessed	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Morianton	1
did	1
claim	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Lehi	1
therefore	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
warm	1
contention	1
between	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
took	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
Alma	1
5027	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
possessed	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Lehi	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
appealed	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
assistance	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
Alma	1
5028	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
who	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Morianton	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lehi	1
had	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Moroni	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
fearful	1
lest	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
Alma	1
5029	1
29	1
Therefore	1
Morianton	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
northward	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
large	1
bodies	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5030	1
30	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
carried	1
this	1
plan	1
into	1
effect	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
cause	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
lamented	1
but	1
behold	1
Morianton	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
much	1
passion	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
maid	1
servants	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
beat	1
her	1
much	1
Alma	1
5031	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
fled	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
told	1
Moroni	1
all	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
their	1
intentions	1
to	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5032	1
32	1
Now	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
or	1
rather	1
Moroni	1
feared	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Morianton	1
and	1
unite	1
with	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
would	1
obtain	1
possession	1
of	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
would	1
lay	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
serious	1
consequences	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
yea	1
which	1
consequences	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
overthrow	1
of	1
their	1
liberty	1
Alma	1
5033	1
33	1
Therefore	1
Moroni	1
sent	1
an	1
army	1
with	1
their	1
camp	1
to	1
head	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
to	1
stop	1
their	1
flight	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5034	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
head	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
did	1
head	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
narrow	1
pass	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
yea	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
Alma	1
5035	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
was	1
sent	1
by	1
Moroni	1
which	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Teancum	1
did	1
meet	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
and	1
so	1
stubborn	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
being	1
inspired	1
by	1
his	1
wickedness	1
and	1
his	1
flattering	1
words	1
that	1
a	1
battle	1
commenced	1
between	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Teancum	1
did	1
slay	1
Morianton	1
and	1
defeat	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
prisoners	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Moroni	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
5036	1
36	1
And	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
brought	1
back	1
And	1
upon	1
their	1
covenanting	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace	1
they	1
were	1
restored	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Morianton	1
and	1
a	1
union	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
lands	1
Alma	1
5037	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
had	1
peace	1
restored	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
Nephihah	1
the	1
second	1
chief	1
judge	1
died	1
having	1
filled	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
with	1
perfect	1
uprightness	1
before	1
God	1
Alma	1
5038	1
38	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
had	1
refused	1
Alma	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
those	1
records	1
and	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
esteemed	1
by	1
Alma	1
and	1
his	1
fathers	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
sacred	1
therefore	1
Alma	1
had	1
conferred	1
them	1
upon	1
his	1
son	1
Helaman	1
Alma	1
5039	1
39	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
yea	1
he	1
was	1
appointed	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
and	1
sacred	1
ordinance	1
to	1
judge	1
righteously	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
grant	1
unto	1
them	1
their	1
sacred	1
privileges	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
to	1
support	1
and	1
maintain	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
God	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
wicked	1
to	1
justice	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
crime	1
Alma	1
5040	1
40	1
Now	1
behold	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Pahoran	1
And	1
Pahoran	1
did	1
fill	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
did	1
commence	1
his	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
51	1
Chapter	1
51	1
Alma	1
511	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
they	1
having	1
established	1
peace	1
between	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Morianton	1
concerning	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
having	1
commenced	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
in	1
peace	1
Alma	1
512	1
2	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
long	1
maintain	1
an	1
entire	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
contention	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
Pahoran	1
for	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
desired	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
particular	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
should	1
be	1
altered	1
Alma	1
513	1
3	1
But	1
behold	1
Pahoran	1
would	1
not	1
alter	1
nor	1
suffer	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
be	1
altered	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
sent	1
in	1
their	1
voices	1
with	1
their	1
petitions	1
concerning	1
the	1
altering	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
Alma	1
514	1
4	1
Therefore	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
should	1
be	1
altered	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
desired	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
chief	1
judge	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
therefore	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
warm	1
dispute	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
but	1
not	1
unto	1
bloodshed	1
Alma	1
515	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
Pahoran	1
should	1
be	1
dethroned	1
from	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
were	1
called	1
kingmen	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
should	1
be	1
altered	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
free	1
government	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
516	1
6	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
Pahoran	1
should	1
remain	1
chief	1
judge	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
freemen	1
and	1
thus	1
was	1
the	1
division	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
freemen	1
had	1
sworn	1
or	1
covenanted	1
to	1
maintain	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
their	1
religion	1
by	1
a	1
free	1
government	1
Alma	1
517	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
their	1
contention	1
was	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
freemen	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
retained	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
which	1
caused	1
much	1
rejoicing	1
among	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
liberty	1
who	1
also	1
put	1
the	1
kingmen	1
to	1
silence	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
oppose	1
but	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
freedom	1
Alma	1
518	1
8	1
Now	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
kings	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
high	1
birth	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
be	1
kings	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
supported	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
sought	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
519	1
9	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
critical	1
time	1
for	1
such	1
contentions	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
behold	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
again	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
gathering	1
together	1
soldiers	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
and	1
arming	1
them	1
and	1
preparing	1
for	1
war	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
5110	1
10	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
promise	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
was	1
rash	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
did	1
prepare	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
armies	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5111	1
11	1
Now	1
his	1
armies	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
thousands	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
but	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
great	1
loss	1
Amalickiah	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
great	1
army	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
feared	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
5112	1
12	1
Yea	1
even	1
Amalickiah	1
did	1
himself	1
come	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
their	1
contentions	1
concerning	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
Pahoran	1
Alma	1
5113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
kingmen	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
liberty	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
country	1
Alma	1
5114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
also	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
stubbornness	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
labored	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
diligence	1
to	1
preserve	1
yea	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
anger	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
5115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
petition	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
Moroni	1
power	1
to	1
compel	1
those	1
dissenters	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
country	1
or	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death	1
Alma	1
5116	1
16	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
care	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
such	1
contentions	1
and	1
dissensions	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
behold	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
hitherto	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
destruction	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
granted	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Alma	1
5117	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
commanded	1
that	1
his	1
army	1
should	1
go	1
against	1
those	1
kingmen	1
to	1
pull	1
down	1
their	1
pride	1
and	1
their	1
nobility	1
and	1
level	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
earth	1
or	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
and	1
support	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
liberty	1
Alma	1
5118	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
pull	1
down	1
their	1
pride	1
and	1
their	1
nobility	1
insomuch	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
lift	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Moroni	1
they	1
were	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
leveled	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
5119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
thousand	1
of	1
those	1
dissenters	1
who	1
were	1
hewn	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
leaders	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
in	1
battle	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
their	1
trials	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
Alma	1
5120	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
those	1
dissenters	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
smitten	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
hoist	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
liberty	1
upon	1
their	1
towers	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
Alma	1
5121	1
21	1
And	1
thus	1
Moroni	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
those	1
kingmen	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
any	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
appellation	1
of	1
kingmen	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
stubbornness	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
professed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
nobility	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
humble	1
themselves	1
like	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
to	1
fight	1
valiantly	1
for	1
their	1
freedom	1
from	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
5122	1
22	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
Moroni	1
was	1
thus	1
breaking	1
down	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
and	1
subjecting	1
them	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
civilization	1
and	1
making	1
regulations	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moroni	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
5123	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moroni	1
therefore	1
Amalickiah	1
did	1
drive	1
them	1
slaying	1
many	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
yea	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
fortifications	1
Alma	1
5124	1
24	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moroni	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lehi	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
made	1
preparations	1
and	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
5125	1
25	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amalickiah	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
to	1
battle	1
but	1
kept	1
them	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
leaving	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
to	1
maintain	1
and	1
defend	1
it	1
Alma	1
5126	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
many	1
cities	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Morianton	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Omner	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gid	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
5127	1
27	1
And	1
thus	1
had	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
cunning	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
so	1
many	1
cities	1
by	1
their	1
numberless	1
hosts	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
strongly	1
fortified	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
fortifications	1
of	1
Moroni	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
afforded	1
strongholds	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5128	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
marched	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
driving	1
the	1
Nephites	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
slaying	1
many	1
Alma	1
5129	1
29	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
Teancum	1
who	1
had	1
slain	1
Morianton	1
and	1
had	1
headed	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
his	1
flight	1
Alma	1
5130	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
headed	1
Amalickiah	1
also	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
marching	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
numerous	1
army	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5131	1
31	1
But	1
behold	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
disappointment	1
by	1
being	1
repulsed	1
by	1
Teancum	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
great	1
warriors	1
for	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
Teancum	1
did	1
exceed	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
their	1
strength	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
skill	1
of	1
war	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
gain	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5132	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
harass	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
even	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
dark	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Teancum	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
Amalickiah	1
did	1
pitch	1
his	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
were	1
they	1
driven	1
Alma	1
5133	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
had	1
come	1
Teancum	1
and	1
his	1
servant	1
stole	1
forth	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
and	1
behold	1
sleep	1
had	1
overpowered	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
much	1
fatigue	1
which	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
labors	1
and	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
Alma	1
5134	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Teancum	1
stole	1
privily	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
javelin	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
immediately	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
awake	1
his	1
servants	1
Alma	1
5135	1
35	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
again	1
privily	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
camp	1
and	1
behold	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
asleep	1
and	1
he	1
awoke	1
them	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
Alma	1
5136	1
36	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
armies	1
should	1
stand	1
in	1
readiness	1
lest	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
awakened	1
and	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Alma	1
5137	1
37	1
And	1
thus	1
endeth	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
thus	1

days	1
of	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
521	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
behold	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
awoke	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
behold	1
they	1
found	1
Amalickiah	1
was	1
dead	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
tent	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
saw	1
that	1
Teancum	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
battle	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
Alma	1
522	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
this	1
they	1
were	1
affrighted	1
and	1
they	1
abandoned	1
their	1
design	1
in	1
marching	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
and	1
retreated	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
and	1
sought	1
protection	1
in	1
their	1
fortifications	1
Alma	1
523	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
was	1
appointed	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Ammoron	1
thus	1
king	1
Ammoron	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
king	1
Amalickiah	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Alma	1
524	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
command	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
maintain	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
any	1
cities	1
save	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
blood	1
Alma	1
525	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
Teancum	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
maintain	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
and	1
also	1
seeing	1
the	1
enormity	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
Teancum	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
attack	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
forts	1
Alma	1
526	1
6	1
But	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
men	1
round	1
about	1
as	1
if	1
making	1
preparations	1
for	1
war	1
yea	1
and	1
truly	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
against	1
them	1
by	1
casting	1
up	1
walls	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
preparing	1
places	1
of	1
resort	1
Alma	1
527	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
kept	1
thus	1
preparing	1
for	1
war	1
until	1
Moroni	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
strengthen	1
his	1
army	1
Alma	1
528	1
8	1
And	1
Moroni	1
also	1
sent	1
orders	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
retain	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
fell	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
taken	1
many	1
prisoners	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
retain	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
as	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
those	1
whom	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
taken	1
Alma	1
529	1
9	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
sent	1
orders	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
fortify	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
secure	1
the	1
narrow	1
pass	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
lest	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
obtain	1
that	1
point	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
harass	1
them	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
Alma	1
5210	1
10	1
And	1
Moroni	1
also	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
faithful	1
in	1
maintaining	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
seek	1
every	1
opportunity	1
to	1
scourge	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
that	1
perhaps	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
again	1
by	1
stratagem	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
would	1
fortify	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5211	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
would	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
but	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
upon	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
and	1
behold	1
I	1
go	1
against	1
them	1
therefore	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
5212	1
12	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
Ammoron	1
had	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
concerning	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
had	1
marched	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
Alma	1
5213	1
13	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
was	1
endeavoring	1
to	1
harass	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
to	1
draw	1
away	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
forces	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
also	1
harass	1
the	1
Nephites	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
east	1
sea	1
and	1
should	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
armies	1
Alma	1
5214	1
14	1
And	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
those	1
dangerous	1
circumstances	1
in	1
the	1
ending	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
5215	1
15	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
Teancum	1
by	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Moroniwho	1
had	1
established	1
armies	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
the	1
west	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
had	1
begun	1
his	1
march	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
assist	1
Teancum	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
in	1
retaking	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
Alma	1
5216	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Teancum	1
had	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
and	1
retake	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
Alma	1
5217	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Teancum	1
made	1
preparations	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
and	1
march	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
overpower	1
them	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
fortifications	1
therefore	1
he	1
abandoned	1
his	1
designs	1
and	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Moroni	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
strength	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
Alma	1
5218	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
did	1
arrive	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Bountiful	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
5219	1
19	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Teancum	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
captains	1
held	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
warwhat	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
battle	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
flatter	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
strongholds	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
gain	1
advantage	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
take	1
again	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
Alma	1
5220	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
they	1
sent	1
embassies	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
which	1
protected	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
to	1
their	1
leader	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Jacob	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
plains	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
cities	1
But	1
behold	1
Jacob	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Zoramite	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
plains	1
Alma	1
5221	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
having	1
no	1
hopes	1
of	1
meeting	1
them	1
upon	1
fair	1
grounds	1
therefore	1
he	1
resolved	1
upon	1
a	1
plan	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
decoy	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
strongholds	1
Alma	1
5222	1
22	1
Therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
Teancum	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
march	1
down	1
near	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
by	1
night	1
marched	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Mulek	1
and	1
thus	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
the	1
guards	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
discovered	1
Teancum	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
their	1
leader	1
Alma	1
5223	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
against	1
Teancum	1
supposing	1
by	1
their	1
numbers	1
to	1
overpower	1
Teancum	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
And	1
as	1
Teancum	1
saw	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
coming	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
retreat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5224	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
they	1
took	1
courage	1
and	1
pursued	1
them	1
with	1
vigor	1
And	1
while	1
Teancum	1
was	1
thus	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
pursuing	1
them	1
in	1
vain	1
behold	1
Moroni	1
commanded	1
that	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
should	1
march	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
Alma	1
5225	1
25	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
city	1
yea	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
yield	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
5226	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
Moroni	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Mulek	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
while	1
he	1
marched	1
with	1
the	1
remainder	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
Teancum	1
Alma	1
5227	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
pursue	1
Teancum	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
Lehi	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
army	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
Alma	1
5228	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
beheld	1
Lehi	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
coming	1
against	1
them	1
they	1
fled	1
in	1
much	1
confusion	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
obtain	1
the	1
city	1
Mulek	1
before	1
Lehi	1
should	1
overtake	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
wearied	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Lehi	1
were	1
fresh	1
Alma	1
5229	1
29	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
Moroni	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
feared	1
was	1
Lehi	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
Alma	1
5230	1
30	1
Now	1
Lehi	1
was	1
not	1
desirous	1
to	1
overtake	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
Alma	1
5231	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
retreated	1
far	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Moroni	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Lehi	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
fresh	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
strength	1
but	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
wearied	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
long	1
march	1
Alma	1
5232	1
32	1
And	1
Moroni	1
commanded	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
5233	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jacob	1
being	1
their	1
leader	1
being	1
also	1
a	1
Zoramite	1
and	1
having	1
an	1
unconquerable	1
spirit	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
forth	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
exceeding	1
fury	1
against	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
5234	1
34	1
Moroni	1
being	1
in	1
their	1
course	1
of	1
march	1
therefore	1
Jacob	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
and	1
cut	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
But	1
behold	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
more	1
powerful	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5235	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
fought	1
on	1
both	1
hands	1
with	1
exceeding	1
fury	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
slain	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
yea	1
and	1
Moroni	1
was	1
wounded	1
and	1
Jacob	1
was	1
killed	1
Alma	1
5236	1
36	1
And	1
Lehi	1
pressed	1
upon	1
their	1
rear	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
with	1
his	1
strong	1
men	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
delivered	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
being	1
much	1
confused	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
to	1
go	1
or	1
to	1
strike	1
Alma	1
5237	1
37	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
seeing	1
their	1
confusion	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
your	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
behold	1
we	1
will	1
forbear	1
shedding	1
your	1
blood	1
Alma	1
5238	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
also	1
commanded	1
their	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
Alma	1
5239	1
39	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
deliver	1
up	1
their	1
swords	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
were	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
march	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
Alma	1
5240	1
40	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
prisoners	1
who	1
were	1
taken	1
exceeded	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
yea	1
more	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
Alma	1
53	1
Chapter	1
53	1
Alma	1
531	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
guards	1
over	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
bury	1
their	1
dead	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
Moroni	1
placed	1
men	1
over	1
them	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
while	1
they	1
should	1
perform	1
their	1
labors	1
Alma	1
532	1
2	1
And	1
Moroni	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
with	1
Lehi	1
and	1
took	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
Lehi	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
Lehi	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Moroni	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
battles	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
and	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
each	1
others	1
safety	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
beloved	1
by	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
also	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
533	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
finished	1
burying	1
their	1
dead	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
they	1
were	1
marched	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
Teancum	1
by	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
commence	1
laboring	1
in	1
digging	1
a	1
ditch	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
or	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
Alma	1
534	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
build	1
a	1
breastwork	1
of	1
timbers	1
upon	1
the	1
inner	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
up	1
dirt	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
against	1
the	1
breastwork	1
of	1
timbers	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
labor	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
encircled	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Bountiful	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
wall	1
of	1
timbers	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
an	1
exceeding	1
height	1
Alma	1
535	1
5	1
And	1
this	1
city	1
became	1
an	1
exceeding	1
stronghold	1
ever	1
after	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
they	1
did	1
guard	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
even	1
within	1
a	1
wall	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
build	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
labor	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
while	1
at	1
their	1
labor	1
and	1
he	1
desired	1
all	1
his	1
forces	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
536	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
had	1
thus	1
gained	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
holds	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
built	1
a	1
stronghold	1
to	1
retain	1
his	1
prisoners	1
Alma	1
537	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
attempt	1
a	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
that	1
year	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
employ	1
his	1
men	1
in	1
preparing	1
for	1
war	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
making	1
fortifications	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
delivering	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
from	1
famine	1
and	1
affliction	1
and	1
providing	1
food	1
for	1
their	1
armies	1
Alma	1
538	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
south	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Moroni	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
some	1
intrigue	1
amongst	1
the	1
Nephites	1
which	1
caused	1
dissensions	1
amongst	1
them	1
had	1
gained	1
some	1
ground	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
cities	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
539	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
amongst	1
themselves	1
yea	1
because	1
of	1
dissensions	1
and	1
intrigue	1
among	1
themselves	1
they	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
circumstances	1
Alma	1
5310	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
concerning	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
were	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
by	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
or	1
rather	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
had	1
ever	1
since	1
been	1
protected	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5311	1
11	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
oath	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
from	1
taking	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
would	1
shed	1
blood	1
more	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
oath	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
perished	1
yea	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
suffered	1
themselves	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
pity	1
and	1
the	1
exceeding	1
love	1
which	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
had	1
had	1
for	1
them	1
Alma	1
5312	1
12	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
they	1
ever	1
had	1
been	1
protected	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5313	1
13	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
afflictions	1
and	1
tribulations	1
which	1
the	1
Nephites	1
bore	1
for	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
and	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
Alma	1
5314	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
they	1
were	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
persuasions	1
of	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
Alma	1
5315	1
15	1
And	1
Helaman	1
feared	1
lest	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
they	1
should	1
lose	1
their	1
souls	1
therefore	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
this	1
covenant	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
behold	1
their	1
brethren	1
wade	1
through	1
their	1
afflictions	1
in	1
their	1
dangerous	1
circumstances	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
Alma	1
5316	1
16	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
they	1
had	1
many	1
sons	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
themselves	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5317	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
yea	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
laying	1
down	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
yea	1
even	1
they	1
covenanted	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
their	1
liberty	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
fight	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
themselves	1
from	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
5318	1
18	1
Now	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
thousand	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
entered	1
into	1
this	1
covenant	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
country	1
Alma	1
5319	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
as	1
they	1
never	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
a	1
disadvantage	1
to	1
the	1
Nephites	1
they	1
became	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
support	1
for	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
Helaman	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
leader	1
Alma	1
5320	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
valiant	1
for	1
courage	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
strength	1
and	1
activity	1
but	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
allthey	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
true	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
they	1
were	1
entrusted	1
Alma	1
5321	1
21	1
Yea	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
uprightly	1
before	1
him	1
Alma	1
5322	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Helaman	1
did	1
march	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
thousand	1
stripling	1
soldiers	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
by	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
Alma	1
5323	1
23	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
54	1
Chapter	1
54	1
Alma	1
541	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
Ammoron	1
sent	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
exchange	1
prisoners	1
Alma	1
542	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
felt	1
to	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
at	1
this	1
request	1
for	1
he	1
desired	1
the	1
provisions	1
which	1
were	1
imparted	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
prisoners	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
desired	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
strengthening	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
Alma	1
543	1
3	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
taken	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
nor	1
a	1
child	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
Moroni	1
or	1
the	1
prisoners	1
whom	1
Moroni	1
had	1
taken	1
therefore	1
Moroni	1
resolved	1
upon	1
a	1
stratagem	1
to	1
obtain	1
as	1
many	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
from	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
Alma	1
544	1
4	1
Therefore	1
he	1
wrote	1
an	1
epistle	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Ammoron	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
an	1
epistle	1
to	1
Moroni	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
unto	1
Ammoron	1
saying	1
Alma	1
545	1
5	1
Behold	1
Ammoron	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
this	1
war	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
waged	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
or	1
rather	1
which	1
thy	1
brother	1
hath	1
waged	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
still	1
determined	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
Alma	1
546	1
6	1
Behold	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
you	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
almighty	1
wrath	1
which	1
doth	1
hang	1
over	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
and	1
withdraw	1
your	1
armies	1
into	1
your	1
own	1
lands	1
or	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possessions	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
547	1
7	1
Yea	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
if	1
ye	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
hearkening	1
unto	1
them	1
yea	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
you	1
concerning	1
that	1
awful	1
hell	1
that	1
awaits	1
to	1
receive	1
such	1
murderers	1
as	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
brother	1
have	1
been	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
and	1
withdraw	1
your	1
murderous	1
purposes	1
and	1
return	1
with	1
your	1
armies	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
lands	1
Alma	1
548	1
8	1
But	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
once	1
rejected	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
may	1
expect	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
again	1
Alma	1
549	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
prepared	1
to	1
receive	1
you	1
yea	1
and	1
except	1
you	1
withdraw	1
your	1
purposes	1
behold	1
ye	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
that	1
God	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
rejected	1
upon	1
you	1
even	1
to	1
your	1
utter	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
5410	1
10	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
our	1
armies	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
withdraw	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
visited	1
with	1
death	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
retain	1
our	1
cities	1
and	1
our	1
lands	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
maintain	1
our	1
religion	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
Alma	1
5411	1
11	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
supposeth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
vain	1
or	1
it	1
supposeth	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
hell	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
close	1
my	1
epistle	1
by	1
telling	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
exchange	1
prisoners	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
on	1
conditions	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
deliver	1
up	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
for	1
one	1
prisoner	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
exchange	1
Alma	1
5412	1
12	1
And	1
behold	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
against	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
armies	1
yea	1
even	1
I	1
will	1
arm	1
my	1
women	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
you	1
even	1
into	1
your	1
own	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
inheritance	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
blood	1
for	1
blood	1
yea	1
life	1
for	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
battle	1
even	1
until	1
you	1
are	1
destroyed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
5413	1
13	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
anger	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
people	1
ye	1
have	1
sought	1
to	1
murder	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
sought	1
to	1
defend	1
ourselves	1
But	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
us	1
more	1
we	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
you	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
seek	1
our	1
land	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
inheritance	1
Alma	1
5414	1
14	1
Now	1
I	1
close	1
my	1
epistle	1
I	1
am	1
Moroni	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5415	1
15	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ammoron	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
this	1
epistle	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
another	1
epistle	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
saying	1
Alma	1
5416	1
16	1
I	1
am	1
Ammoron	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Amalickiah	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
murdered	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
his	1
blood	1
upon	1
you	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
armies	1
for	1
I	1
fear	1
not	1
your	1
threatenings	1
Alma	1
5417	1
17	1
For	1
behold	1
your	1
fathers	1
did	1
wrong	1
their	1
brethren	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
rob	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
when	1
it	1
rightly	1
belonged	1
unto	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
lay	1
down	1
your	1
arms	1
and	1
subject	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
government	1
doth	1
rightly	1
belong	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
weapons	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
war	1
no	1
more	1
Alma	1
5419	1

Behold	1
ye	1
have	1
breathed	1
out	1
many	1
threatenings	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
but	1
behold	1
we	1
fear	1
not	1
your	1
threatenings	1
Alma	1
5420	1
20	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
to	1
exchange	1
prisoners	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
request	1
gladly	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
my	1
food	1
for	1
my	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
wage	1
a	1
war	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
eternal	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
subjecting	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
our	1
authority	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
eternal	1
extinction	1
Alma	1
5421	1
21	1
And	1
as	1
concerning	1
that	1
God	1
whom	1
ye	1
say	1
we	1
have	1
rejected	1
behold	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
being	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
Alma	1
5422	1
22	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
devil	1
and	1
a	1
hell	1
behold	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
send	1
you	1
there	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
murdered	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
hinted	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
gone	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
But	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
matter	1
not	1
Alma	1
5423	1
23	1
I	1
am	1
Ammoron	1
and	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Zoram	1
whom	1
your	1
fathers	1
pressed	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
Alma	1
5424	1
24	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
bold	1
Lamanite	1
behold	1
this	1
war	1
hath	1
been	1
waged	1
to	1
avenge	1
their	1
wrongs	1
and	1
to	1
maintain	1
and	1
to	1
obtain	1
their	1
rights	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
I	1
close	1
my	1
epistle	1
to	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
55	1
Chapter	1
55	1
Alma	1
551	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
received	1
this	1
epistle	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
angry	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Ammoron	1
had	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
fraud	1
yea	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Ammoron	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
just	1
cause	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
wage	1
a	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
552	1
2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
exchange	1
prisoners	1
with	1
Ammoron	1
save	1
he	1
will	1
withdraw	1
his	1
purpose	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
stated	1
in	1
my	1
epistle	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
power	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
got	1
Alma	1
553	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
do	1
guard	1
my	1
people	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
and	1
as	1
Ammoron	1
would	1
not	1
grant	1
unto	1
me	1
mine	1
epistle	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
yea	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
death	1
among	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
shall	1
sue	1
for	1
peace	1
Alma	1
554	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
a	1
search	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
among	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
perhaps	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Laman	1
among	1
them	1
Alma	1
555	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
one	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Laman	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
who	1
was	1
murdered	1
by	1
Amalickiah	1
Alma	1
556	1
6	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
Laman	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
guards	1
who	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
557	1
7	1
Now	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
guarded	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gid	1
therefore	1
Moroni	1
appointed	1
Laman	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
Alma	1
558	1
8	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
evening	1
Laman	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
guards	1
who	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
coming	1
and	1
they	1
hailed	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them	1
Fear	1
not	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Lamanite	1
Behold	1
we	1
have	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
sleep	1
and	1
behold	1
we	1
have	1
taken	1
of	1
their	1
wine	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
us	1
Alma	1
559	1
9	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Give	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
wine	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
drink	1
we	1
are	1
glad	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
thus	1
taken	1
wine	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
weary	1
Alma	1
5510	1
10	1
But	1
Laman	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Let	1
us	1
keep	1
of	1
our	1
wine	1
till	1
we	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
battle	1
But	1
this	1
saying	1
only	1
made	1
them	1
more	1
desirous	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
Alma	1
5511	1
11	1
For	1
said	1
they	1
We	1
are	1
weary	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
wine	1
for	1
our	1
rations	1
which	1
will	1
strengthen	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5512	1
12	1
And	1
Laman	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
You	1
may	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
desires	1
Alma	1
5513	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
freely	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
their	1
taste	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
of	1
it	1
more	1
freely	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
strong	1
having	1
been	1
prepared	1
in	1
its	1
strength	1
Alma	1
5514	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
they	1
did	1
drink	1
and	1
were	1
merry	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
drunken	1
Alma	1
5515	1
15	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Laman	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
drunken	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Moroni	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
Alma	1
5516	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
Moroni	1
And	1
Moroni	1
had	1
prepared	1
his	1
men	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Gid	1
while	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
and	1
drunken	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
unto	1
the	1
prisoners	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
armed	1
Alma	1
5517	1
17	1
Yea	1
even	1
to	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
use	1
a	1
weapon	1
of	1
war	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
armed	1
all	1
those	1
prisoners	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
profound	1
silence	1
Alma	1
5518	1
18	1
But	1
had	1
they	1
awakened	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
drunken	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
could	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
Alma	1
5519	1
19	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Moroni	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
delight	1
in	1
murder	1
or	1
bloodshed	1
but	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
destruction	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
bring	1
upon	1
him	1
injustice	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
drunkenness	1
Alma	1
5520	1
20	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
his	1
desires	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
armed	1
those	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
within	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
power	1
to	1
gain	1
possession	1
of	1
those	1
parts	1
which	1
were	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
Alma	1
5521	1
21	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
caused	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
withdraw	1
a	1
pace	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
surround	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5522	1
22	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
awoke	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
they	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
without	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
prisoners	1
were	1
armed	1
within	1
Alma	1
5523	1
23	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
circumstances	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
expedient	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
therefore	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
demanded	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
pleading	1
for	1
mercy	1
Alma	1
5524	1
24	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Moroni	1
He	1
took	1
them	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
should	1
be	1
liberated	1
who	1
were	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
join	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
strength	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
Alma	1
5525	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
commence	1
a	1
labor	1
in	1
strengthening	1
the	1
fortifications	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
Gid	1
Alma	1
5526	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
fortified	1
the	1
city	1
Gid	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desires	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
prisoners	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
guarded	1
that	1
city	1
with	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
force	1
Alma	1
5527	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
keep	1
and	1
protect	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
also	1
maintain	1
all	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
advantage	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
retaken	1
Alma	1
5528	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
victorious	1
and	1
to	1
reclaim	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
their	1
privileges	1
Alma	1
5529	1
29	1
Many	1
time	1
did	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
attempt	1
to	1
encircle	1
them	1
about	1
by	1
night	1
but	1
in	1
these	1
attempts	1
they	1
did	1
lose	1
many	1
prisoners	1
Alma	1
5530	1
30	1
And	1
many	1
times	1
did	1
they	1
attempt	1
to	1
administer	1
of	1
their	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
Nephites	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
poison	1
or	1
with	1
drunkenness	1
Alma	1
5531	1
31	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
not	1
slow	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
in	1
this	1
their	1
time	1
of	1
affliction	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
snares	1
yea	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
partake	1
of	1
their	1
wine	1
save	1
they	1
had	1
first	1
given	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
prisoners	1
Alma	1
5532	1
32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
cautious	1
that	1
no	1
poison	1
should	1
be	1
administered	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
if	1
their	1
wine	1
would	1
poison	1
a	1
Lamanite	1
it	1
would	1
also	1
poison	1
a	1
Nephite	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
try	1
all	1
their	1
liquors	1
Alma	1
5533	1
33	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
for	1
Moroni	1
to	1
make	1
preparations	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
city	1
Morianton	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
by	1
their	1
labors	1
fortified	1
the	1
city	1
Morianton	1
until	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
an	1
exceeding	1
stronghold	1
Alma	1
5534	1
34	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
bringing	1
new	1
forces	1
into	1
that	1
city	1
and	1
also	1
new	1
supplies	1
of	1
provisions	1
Alma	1
5535	1

And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1

Chapter	1

Alma	1
561	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
Moroni	1
received	1
an	1
epistle	1
from	1
Helaman	1
stating	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
562	1
2	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
saying	1
My	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Moroni	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
tribulations	1
of	1
our	1
warfare	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
concerning	1
our	1
warfare	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
563	1
3	1
Behold	1
two	1
thousand	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
whom	1
Ammon	1
brought	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephinow	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
descendants	1
of	1
Laman	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
Alma	1
564	1
4	1
Now	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
rehearse	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
their	1
traditions	1
or	1
their	1
unbelief	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
concerning	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
Alma	1
565	1
5	1
Therefore	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
two	1
thousand	1
of	1
these	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
taken	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
leader	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
defend	1
our	1
country	1
Alma	1
566	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
also	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
made	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
shed	1
blood	1
Alma	1
567	1
7	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
our	1
afflictions	1
and	1
our	1
tribulations	1
for	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
our	1
defence	1
Alma	1
568	1
8	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
break	1
this	1
covenant	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
supposing	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
strengthen	1
us	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
suffer	1
more	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
Alma	1
569	1
9	1
But	1
behold	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
For	1
behold	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
I	1
Helaman	1
did	1
march	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
thousand	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Judea	1
to	1
assist	1
Antipus	1
whom	1
ye	1
had	1
appointed	1
a	1
leader	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
5610	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
join	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
sons	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
sons	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Antipus	1
in	1
which	1
strength	1
Antipus	1
did	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
behold	1
his	1
army	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
because	1
their	1
forces	1
had	1
slain	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
mourn	1
Alma	1
5611	1
11	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
may	1
console	1
ourselves	1
in	1
this	1
point	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
happy	1
Alma	1
5612	1
12	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
also	1
retained	1
many	1
prisoners	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
chief	1
captains	1
for	1
none	1
other	1
have	1
they	1
spared	1
alive	1
And	1
we	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
slain	1
Alma	1
5613	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
obtained	1
possession	1
by	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
valiant	1
men	1
Alma	1
5614	1
14	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
or	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zeezrom	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Cumeni	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
Alma	1
5615	1
15	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
possessed	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Judea	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
Antipus	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
toiling	1
with	1
their	1
might	1
to	1
fortify	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
5616	1
16	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
depressed	1
in	1
body	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
spirit	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
fought	1
valiantly	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
toiled	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
maintain	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
had	1
suffered	1
great	1
afflictions	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Alma	1
5617	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
conquer	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
or	1
die	1
therefore	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
force	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
with	1
me	1
yea	1
those	1
sons	1
of	1
mine	1
gave	1
them	1
great	1
hopes	1
and	1
much	1
joy	1
Alma	1
5618	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
Antipus	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
greater	1
strength	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
by	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
Ammoron	1
to	1
not	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Judea	1
or	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
5619	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
were	1
we	1
favored	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
had	1
they	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
our	1
weakness	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
perhaps	1
destroyed	1
our	1
little	1
army	1
but	1
thus	1
were	1
we	1
preserved	1
Alma	1
5620	1
20	1
They	1
were	1
commanded	1
by	1
Ammoron	1
to	1
maintain	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
we	1
had	1
prepared	1
our	1
city	1
and	1
ourselves	1
for	1
defence	1
Alma	1
5621	1
21	1
Now	1
we	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
desirous	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
strongholds	1
Alma	1
5622	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
kept	1
spies	1
out	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
pass	1
us	1
by	1
night	1
nor	1
by	1
day	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
our	1
other	1
cities	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
northward	1
Alma	1
5623	1
23	1
For	1
we	1
knew	1
in	1
those	1
cities	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
therefore	1
we	1
were	1
desirous	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
pass	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
and	1
thus	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
We	1
supposed	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
overpower	1
them	1
but	1
behold	1
we	1
were	1
disappointed	1
in	1
this	1
our	1
desire	1
Alma	1
5624	1
24	1
They	1
durst	1
not	1
pass	1
by	1
us	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
neither	1
durst	1
they	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
Alma	1
5625	1
25	1
Neither	1
durst	1
they	1
march	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
neither	1
durst	1
they	1
cross	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Sidon	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
Alma	1
5626	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
with	1
their	1
forces	1
they	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
maintain	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
Alma	1
5627	1
27	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
us	1
many	1
provisions	1
from	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
those	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
sons	1
Alma	1
5628	1
28	1
And	1
also	1
there	1
were	1
sent	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
unto	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
were	1
prepared	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
provisions	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Alma	1
5629	1
29	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
thus	1
seeing	1
our	1
forces	1
increase	1
daily	1
and	1
provisions	1
arrive	1
for	1
our	1
support	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
fearful	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
sally	1
forth	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
our	1
receiving	1
provisions	1
and	1
strength	1
Alma	1
5630	1
30	1
Now	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
uneasy	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
we	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
stratagem	1
into	1
effect	1
upon	1
them	1
therefore	1
Antipus	1
ordered	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
march	1
forth	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
sons	1
to	1
a	1
neighboring	1
city	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
carrying	1
provisions	1
to	1
a	1
neighboring	1
city	1
Alma	1
5631	1
31	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
march	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
beyond	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
5632	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
our	1
provisions	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
that	1
city	1
Alma	1
5633	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Antipus	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
leaving	1
the	1
remainder	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
city	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
march	1
forth	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
with	1
my	1
little	1
army	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
Antiparah	1
Alma	1
5634	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
Antiparah	1
were	1
stationed	1
the	1
strongest	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
Alma	1
5635	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
informed	1
by	1
their	1
spies	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
with	1
their	1
army	1
and	1
marched	1
against	1
us	1
Alma	1
5636	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
northward	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
did	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5637	1
37	1
Yea	1
even	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
insomuch	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Antipus	1
pursuing	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
might	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
but	1
pursued	1
their	1
march	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
after	1
us	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
intent	1
to	1
slay	1
us	1
before	1
Antipus	1
should	1
overtake	1
them	1
and	1
this	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
surrounded	1
by	1
our	1
people	1
Alma	1
5638	1
38	1
And	1
now	1
Antipus	1
beholding	1
our	1
danger	1
did	1
speed	1
the	1
march	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
us	1
neither	1
did	1
Antipus	1
overtake	1
them	1
therefore	1
we	1
did	1
camp	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
Alma	1
5639	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
pursuing	1
us	1
Now	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
them	1
yea	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
my	1
little	1
sons	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
therefore	1
we	1
did	1
continue	1
our	1
march	1
and	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
march	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
5640	1
40	1
Now	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
surrounded	1
neither	1
would	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
overtake	1
me	1
and	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
against	1
them	1
but	1
be	1
slain	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
their	1
escape	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
did	1
flee	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
dark	1
Alma	1
5641	1
41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
came	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
Alma	1
5642	1
42	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
pursue	1
us	1
far	1
before	1
they	1
halted	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month	1
Alma	1
5643	1
43	1
And	1
now	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
overtaken	1
by	1
Antipus	1
we	1
knew	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
men	1
Behold	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
halted	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
come	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
catch	1
us	1
in	1
their	1
snare	1
Alma	1
5644	1
44	1
Therefore	1
what	1
say	1
ye	1
my	1
sons	1
will	1
ye	1
go	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
5645	1
45	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Moroni	1
that	1
never	1
had	1
I	1
seen	1
so	1
great	1
courage	1
nay	1
not	1
amongst	1
all	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
5646	1
46	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
called	1
them	1
my	1
sons	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
very	1
young	1
even	1
so	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Father	1
behold	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
fall	1
then	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
slay	1
our	1
brethren	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
us	1
alone	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
overpower	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Antipus	1
Alma	1
5647	1
47	1
Now	1
they	1
never	1
had	1
fought	1
yet	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
death	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
think	1
more	1
upon	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
upon	1
their	1
lives	1
yea	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
their	1
mothers	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
God	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
Alma	1
5648	1
48	1
And	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
their	1
mothers	1
saying	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
doubt	1
our	1
mothers	1
knew	1
it	1
Alma	1
5649	1
49	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
return	1
with	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
against	1
these	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
pursued	1
us	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Antipus	1
had	1
overtaken	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
battle	1
had	1
commenced	1
Alma	1
5650	1
50	1
The	1
army	1
of	1
Antipus	1
being	1
weary	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
long	1
march	1
in	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
returned	1
with	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
obtained	1
their	1
purpose	1
Alma	1
5651	1
51	1
For	1
Antipus	1
had	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
leaders	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
weariness	1
which	1
was	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
their	1
marchtherefore	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Antipus	1
being	1
confused	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
their	1
leaders	1
began	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5652	1
52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
took	1
courage	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pursue	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
pursuing	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
vigor	1
when	1
Helaman	1
came	1
upon	1
their	1
rear	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
exceedingly	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
halted	1
and	1
turned	1
upon	1
Helaman	1
Alma	1
5653	1
53	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Antipus	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
turned	1
them	1
about	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
their	1
men	1
and	1
came	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5654	1
54	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Antipus	1
and	1
I	1
with	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
did	1
surround	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
deliver	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
also	1
themselves	1
as	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
5655	1
55	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
surrendered	1
themselves	1
up	1
unto	1
us	1
behold	1
I	1
numbered	1
those	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
with	1
me	1
fearing	1
lest	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
slain	1
Alma	1
5656	1
56	1
But	1
behold	1
to	1
my	1
great	1
joy	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
one	1
soul	1
of	1
them	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
fought	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
never	1
were	1
men	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
fought	1
with	1
such	1
miraculous	1
strength	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
mighty	1
power	1
did	1
they	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
frighten	1
them	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
did	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
up	1
as	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
5657	1
57	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
our	1
prisoners	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
guard	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
we	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
of	1
Antipus	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
I	1
took	1
and	1
joined	1
them	1
to	1
my	1
stripling	1
Ammonites	1
and	1
took	1
our	1
march	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Judea	1
Alma	1
57	1
Chapter	1
57	1
Alma	1
571	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
received	1
an	1
epistle	1
from	1
Ammoron	1
the	1
king	1
stating	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
deliver	1
up	1
those	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
whom	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
unto	1
us	1
Alma	1
572	1
2	1
But	1
I	1
sent	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
sure	1
our	1
forces	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
by	1
our	1
force	1
and	1
by	1
delivering	1
up	1
the	1
prisoners	1
for	1
that	1
city	1
we	1
should	1
suppose	1
ourselves	1
unwise	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
only	1
deliver	1
up	1
our	1
prisoners	1
on	1
exchange	1
Alma	1
573	1
3	1
And	1
Ammoron	1
refused	1
mine	1
epistle	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
exchange	1
prisoners	1
therefore	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
preparations	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
Alma	1
574	1
4	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
did	1
leave	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
fled	1
to	1
their	1
other	1
cities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
to	1
fortify	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Antiparah	1
fell	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
Alma	1
575	1
5	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
576	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
we	1
received	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions	1
and	1
also	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
army	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
besides	1
sixty	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
brethren	1
my	1
little	1
band	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
were	1
strong	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
also	1
plenty	1
of	1
provisions	1
brought	1
unto	1
us	1
Alma	1
577	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
our	1
desire	1
to	1
wage	1
a	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
was	1
placed	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
city	1
Cumeni	1
Alma	1
578	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
we	1
soon	1
accomplished	1
our	1
desire	1
yea	1
with	1
our	1
strong	1
force	1
or	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
strong	1
force	1
we	1
did	1
surround	1
by	1
night	1
the	1
city	1
Cumeni	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions	1
Alma	1
579	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
camp	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
for	1
many	1
nights	1
but	1
we	1
did	1
sleep	1
upon	1
our	1
swords	1
and	1
keep	1
guards	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
slay	1
us	1
which	1
they	1
attempted	1
many	1
times	1
but	1
as	1
many	1
times	1
as	1
they	1
attempted	1
this	1
their	1
blood	1
was	1
spilt	1
Alma	1
5710	1
10	1
At	1
length	1
their	1
provisions	1
did	1
arrive	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
night	1
And	1
we	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
Nephites	1
therefore	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
provisions	1
Alma	1
5711	1
11	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
being	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
their	1
support	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
determined	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
city	1
therefore	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
take	1
those	1
provisions	1
and	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
Judea	1
and	1
our	1
prisoners	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
5712	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
lose	1
all	1
hopes	1
of	1
succor	1
therefore	1
they	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
city	1
unto	1
our	1
hands	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
had	1
accomplished	1
our	1
designs	1
in	1
obtaining	1
the	1
city	1
Cumeni	1
Alma	1
5713	1
13	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
our	1
prisoners	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
enormity	1
of	1
our	1
numbers	1
we	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
employ	1
all	1
our	1
force	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
or	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death	1
Alma	1
5714	1
14	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
would	1
break	1
out	1
in	1
great	1
numbers	1
and	1
would	1
fight	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
with	1
clubs	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
slay	1
upwards	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
of	1
them	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
surrendered	1
themselves	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
5715	1
15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
for	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
their	1
lives	1
or	1
guard	1
them	1
sword	1
in	1
hand	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
provisions	1
were	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
sufficient	1
for	1
our	1
own	1
people	1
notwithstanding	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5716	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
those	1
critical	1
circumstances	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
matter	1
to	1
determine	1
concerning	1
these	1
prisoners	1
of	1
war	1
nevertheless	1
we	1
did	1
resolve	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
therefore	1
we	1
selected	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
charge	1
over	1
our	1
prisoners	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
5717	1
17	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
did	1
return	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
inquire	1
of	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
prisoners	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
in	1
season	1
to	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
For	1
behold	1
Ammoron	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
their	1
support	1
a	1
new	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
numerous	1
army	1
of	1
men	1
Alma	1
5718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
men	1
whom	1
we	1
sent	1
with	1
the	1
prisoners	1
did	1
arrive	1
in	1
season	1
to	1
check	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
overpower	1
us	1
Alma	1
5719	1
19	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
little	1
band	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
sixty	1
fought	1
most	1
desperately	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
firm	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
administer	1
death	1
unto	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
opposed	1
them	1
Alma	1
5720	1
20	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
army	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
behold	1
those	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
sixty	1
were	1
firm	1
and	1
undaunted	1
Alma	1
5721	1
21	1
Yea	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
obey	1
and	1
observe	1
to	1
perform	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
with	1
exactness	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
their	1
mothers	1
had	1
taught	1
them	1
Alma	1
5722	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
these	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
selected	1
to	1
convey	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
owe	1
this	1
great	1
victory	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
did	1
beat	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
5723	1
23	1
And	1
we	1
retained	1
our	1
city	1
Cumeni	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
nevertheless	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
great	1
loss	1
Alma	1
5724	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
fled	1
I	1
immediately	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
my	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
their	1
wounds	1
should	1
be	1
dressed	1
Alma	1
5725	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
sixty	1
who	1
had	1
fainted	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
nevertheless	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
great	1
astonishment	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
our	1
whole	1
army	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
soul	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
did	1
perish	1
yea	1
and	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
one	1
soul	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
many	1
wounds	1
Alma	1
5726	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
their	1
preservation	1
was	1
astonishing	1
to	1
our	1
whole	1
army	1
yea	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
spared	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
And	1
we	1
do	1
justly	1
ascribe	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
miraculous	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
believethat	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
God	1
and	1
whosoever	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
preserved	1
by	1
his	1
marvelous	1
power	1
Alma	1
5727	1
27	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
these	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
they	1
are	1
young	1
and	1
their	1
minds	1
are	1
firm	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
continually	1
Alma	1
5728	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
thus	1
taken	1
care	1
of	1
our	1
wounded	1
men	1
and	1
had	1
buried	1
our	1
dead	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
many	1
behold	1
we	1
did	1
inquire	1
of	1
Gid	1
concerning	1
the	1
prisoners	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
started	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
with	1
Alma	1
5729	1
29	1
Now	1
Gid	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
band	1
who	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
5730	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Gid	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Behold	1
we	1
did	1
start	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
with	1
our	1
prisoners	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
meet	1
the	1
spies	1
of	1
our	1
armies	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5731	1
31	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
us	1
sayingBehold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
marching	1
towards	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Cumeni	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
will	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
will	1
destroy	1
our	1
people	1
Alma	1
5732	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
our	1
prisoners	1
did	1
hear	1
their	1
cries	1
which	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
courage	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
against	1
us	1
Alma	1
5733	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
rebellion	1
we	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
our	1
swords	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
run	1
upon	1
our	1
swords	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
broke	1
through	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
us	1
Alma	1
5734	1
34	1
And	1
behold	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fled	1
and	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
overtake	1
them	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
march	1
with	1
speed	1
towards	1
the	1
city	1
Cumeni	1
and	1
behold	1
we	1
did	1
arrive	1
in	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
assist	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
preserving	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
5735	1
35	1
And	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
again	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
has	1
delivered	1
us	1
yea	1
that	1
has	1
done	1
this	1
great	1
thing	1
for	1
us	1
Alma	1
5736	1
36	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
Helaman	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Gid	1
I	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
preserving	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
all	1
perish	1
yea	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
58	1
Chapter	1
58	1
Alma	1
581	1
1	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
our	1
next	1
object	1
was	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
but	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
our	1
small	1
bands	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
remembered	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
hitherto	1
done	1
therefore	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
decoy	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
their	1
strongholds	1
Alma	1
582	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
was	1
our	1
army	1
that	1
we	1
durst	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
attack	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
strongholds	1
Alma	1
583	1
3	1
Yea	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
employ	1
our	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
maintaining	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
regained	1
of	1
our	1
possessions	1
therefore	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
wait	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
more	1
strength	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
new	1
supply	1
of	1
provisions	1
Alma	1
584	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
thus	1
did	1
send	1
an	1
embassy	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
our	1
land	1
to	1
acquaint	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
wait	1
to	1
receive	1
provisions	1
and	1
strength	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
585	1
5	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
did	1
profit	1
us	1
but	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
also	1
receiving	1
great	1
strength	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
provisions	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
our	1
circumstances	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
Alma	1
586	1
6	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
sallying	1
forth	1
against	1
us	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
resolving	1
by	1
stratagem	1
to	1
destroy	1
us	1
nevertheless	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
retreats	1
and	1
their	1
strongholds	1
Alma	1
587	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
wait	1
in	1
these	1
difficult	1
circumstances	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
months	1
even	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
for	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
Alma	1
588	1
8	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
receive	1
food	1
which	1
was	1
guarded	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
to	1
our	1
assistance	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
assistance	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
receive	1
to	1
defend	1
ourselves	1
and	1
our	1
country	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
yea	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
an	1
enemy	1
which	1
was	1
innumerable	1
Alma	1
589	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
these	1
our	1
embarrassments	1
or	1
the	1
cause	1
why	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
more	1
strength	1
unto	1
us	1
we	1
knew	1
not	1
therefore	1
we	1
were	1
grieved	1
and	1
also	1
filled	1
with	1
fear	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
our	1
land	1
to	1
our	1
overthrow	1
and	1
utter	1
destruction	1
Alma	1
5810	1
10	1
Therefore	1
we	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
our	1
souls	1
in	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
strengthen	1
us	1
and	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
give	1
us	1
strength	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
retain	1
our	1
cities	1
and	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
our	1
possessions	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
Alma	1
5811	1
11	1
Yea	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
did	1
visit	1
us	1
with	1
assurances	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
us	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
speak	1
peace	1
to	1
our	1
souls	1
and	1
did	1
grant	1
unto	1
us	1
great	1
faith	1
and	1
did	1
cause	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
hope	1
for	1
our	1
deliverance	1
in	1
him	1
Alma	1
5812	1
12	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
courage	1
with	1
our	1
small	1
force	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
were	1
fixed	1
with	1
a	1
determination	1
to	1
conquer	1
our	1
enemies	1
and	1
to	1
maintain	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
our	1
possessions	1
and	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
liberty	1
Alma	1
5813	1
13	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
might	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness	1
side	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
5814	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
their	1
spies	1
round	1
about	1
us	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
discover	1
the	1
number	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
our	1
army	1
Alma	1
5815	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
strong	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
numbers	1
and	1
fearing	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
their	1
support	1
except	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
us	1
and	1
kill	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
destroy	1
us	1
with	1
their	1
numerous	1
hosts	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
preparations	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
5816	1
16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
preparations	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
us	1
behold	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
Gid	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
should	1
secrete	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Teomner	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
should	1
secrete	1
themselves	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
5817	1
17	1
Now	1
Gid	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
thus	1
secreted	1
themselves	1
behold	1
I	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
my	1
army	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
had	1
first	1
pitched	1
our	1
tents	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
5818	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
their	1
numerous	1
army	1
against	1
us	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
my	1
men	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
should	1
retreat	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
5819	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
follow	1
after	1
us	1
with	1
great	1
speed	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
desirous	1
to	1
overtake	1
us	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
slay	1
us	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
follow	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
pass	1
by	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Gid	1
and	1
Teomner	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5820	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
passed	1
by	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
had	1
passed	1
by	1
Gid	1
and	1
Teomner	1
did	1
rise	1
up	1
from	1
their	1
secret	1
places	1
and	1
did	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
spies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
5821	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
they	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
guards	1
who	1
were	1
left	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
city	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
5822	1
22	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
because	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
suffer	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
save	1
a	1
few	1
guards	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
5823	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Gid	1
and	1
Teomner	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
strongholds	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
course	1
after	1
having	1
traveled	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Alma	1
5824	1
24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
marching	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
afraid	1
lest	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
plan	1
laid	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
on	1
to	1
destruction	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
retreat	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
again	1
yea	1
even	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
Alma	1
5825	1
25	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
weary	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
and	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
therefore	1
they	1
took	1
no	1
thought	1
concerning	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
5826	1
26	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
I	1
caused	1
that	1
my	1
men	1
should	1
not	1
sleep	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
march	1
forward	1
by	1
another	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
5827	1
27	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
our	1
march	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
behold	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
we	1
were	1
beyond	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
arrive	1
before	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
Alma	1
5828	1
28	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
stratagem	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
without	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
Alma	1
5829	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
arrive	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
struck	1
with	1
great	1
fear	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Alma	1
5830	1
30	1
Yea	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
carried	1
with	1
them	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
5831	1
31	1
And	1
those	1
cities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
in	1
our	1
possession	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
our	1
women	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
are	1
returning	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
5832	1
32	1
But	1
behold	1
our	1
armies	1
are	1
small	1
to	1
maintain	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
cities	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
possessions	1
Alma	1
5833	1
33	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
trust	1
in	1
our	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
victory	1
over	1
those	1
lands	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
those	1
cities	1
and	1
those	1
lands	1
which	1
were	1
our	1
own	1
Alma	1
5834	1
34	1
Now	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
does	1
not	1
grant	1
us	1
more	1
strength	1
neither	1
do	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
us	1
know	1
why	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
greater	1
strength	1
Alma	1
5835	1
35	1
Behold	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
what	1
ye	1
are	1
unsuccessful	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
drawn	1
away	1
the	1
forces	1
into	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
if	1
so	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
murmur	1
Alma	1
5836	1
36	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
behold	1
we	1
fear	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
faction	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
send	1
more	1
men	1
to	1
our	1
assistance	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
sent	1
Alma	1
5837	1
37	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
mattereth	1
notwe	1
trust	1
God	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
our	1
armies	1
yea	1
and	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
5838	1
38	1
Behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
5839	1
39	1
And	1
those	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
highly	1
spoken	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
supported	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
falling	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
insomuch	1
that	1
even	1
one	1
soul	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
slain	1
Alma	1
5840	1
40	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
many	1
wounds	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
that	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
God	1
has	1
made	1
them	1
free	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
strict	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
yea	1
they	1
do	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
his	1
judgments	1
and	1
his	1
commandments	1
continually	1
and	1
their	1
faith	1
is	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
prophecies	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Alma	1
5841	1
41	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Moroni	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
who	1
has	1
redeemed	1
us	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
free	1
keep	1
you	1
continually	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
yea	1
and	1
may	1
he	1
favor	1
this	1
people	1
even	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
success	1
in	1
obtaining	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
taken	1
from	1
us	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
our	1
support	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
close	1
mine	1
epistle	1
I	1
am	1
Helaman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alma	1
Alma	1
59	1
Chapter	1
59	1
Alma	1
591	1
1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
after	1
Moroni	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
had	1
read	1
Helamans	1
epistle	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
rejoiced	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
yea	1
the	1
exceeding	1
success	1
which	1
Helaman	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
obtaining	1
those	1
lands	1
which	1
were	1
lost	1
Alma	1
592	1
2	1
Yea	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
rejoice	1
also	1
Alma	1
593	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
immediately	1
sent	1
an	1
epistle	1
to	1
Pahoran	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
cause	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
strengthen	1
Helaman	1
or	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Helaman	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
with	1
ease	1
maintain	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
miraculously	1
prospered	1
in	1
regaining	1
Alma	1
594	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
sent	1
this	1
epistle	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
plan	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
obtain	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
those	1
possessions	1
and	1
cities	1
which	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
Alma	1
595	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
Moroni	1
was	1
thus	1
making	1
preparations	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
battle	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
who	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moroni	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Morianton	1
were	1
attacked	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
596	1
6	1
Yea	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Manti	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
597	1
7	1
And	1
thus	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
numerous	1
yea	1
and	1
receiving	1
strength	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Ammoron	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
slaughter	1
Alma	1
598	1
8	1
And	1
their	1
armies	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
even	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
599	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
Moroni	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
men	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Nephihah	1
to	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
maintain	1
that	1
city	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
easier	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
than	1
to	1
retake	1
it	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
easily	1
maintain	1
that	1
city	1
Alma	1
5910	1
10	1
Therefore	1
he	1
retained	1
all	1
his	1
force	1
to	1
maintain	1
those	1
places	1
which	1
he	1
had	1

And	1
now	1
when	1
Moroni	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
was	1
lost	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
doubt	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1

Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
chief	1
captains	1
They	1
doubted	1
and	1
marveled	1
also	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
over	1
them	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
the	1
government	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
indifference	1
concerning	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
their	1
country	1

1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
wrote	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
who	1
was	1
Pahoran	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
saying	1
Behold	1
I	1
direct	1
mine	1
epistle	1
to	1
Pahoran	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
who	1
is	1
the	1

For	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
condemnation	1
for	1
behold	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
appointed	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
men	1
and	1
arm	1
them	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
cimeters	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
send	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1

in	1
whatsoever	1
parts	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
land	1
Alma	1
603	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
myself	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
have	1
suffered	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
sufferings	1
yea	1
even	1
hunger	1

and	1
fatigue	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1

But	1
behold	1
were	1
this	1
all	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
murmur	1
nor	1
complain	1
Alma	1
605	1

But	1
behold	1
great	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
slaughter	1
among	1
our	1
people	1
yea	1
thousands	1
have	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
while	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
otherwise	1
been	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
rendered	1
unto	1
our	1
armies	1
sufficient	1
strength	1
and	1
succor	1
for	1
them	1
Yea	1
great	1
has	1
been	1
your	1
neglect	1
towards	1
us	1
Alma	1
606	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
neglect	1
yea	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
your	1
thoughtless	1
state	1
Alma	1
607	1

Can	1
you	1
think	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
your	1
thrones	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
thoughtless	1
stupor	1
while	1
your	1
enemies	1
are	1
spreading	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
death	1
around	1
you	1
Yea	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
murdering	1
thousands	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
608	1

Yea	1
even	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
protection	1
yea	1
have	1
placed	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
succored	1
them	1
yea	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
sent	1
armies	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
strengthened	1
them	1
and	1
have	1
saved	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
falling	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1

But	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
allye	1
have	1
withheld	1
your	1
provisions	1
from	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
many	1
have	1
fought	1
and	1
bled	1
out	1
their	1
lives	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
great	1
desires	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
neglect	1
towards	1
them	1
Alma	1
6010	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethrenfor	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
beloved	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
stirred	1
yourselves	1
more	1
diligently	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
but	1
behold	1
ye	1
have	1
neglected	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thousands	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
your	1
heads	1
for	1
vengeance	1
yea	1
for	1
known	1
unto	1

were	1
all	1
their	1
cries	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
sufferings	1

Behold	1
could	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
sit	1
upon	1
your	1
thrones	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
you	1
Behold	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
supposed	1
this	1
ye	1
have	1
supposed	1
in	1
vain	1
Alma	1
6012	1
12	1
Do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
because	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
supposed	1
this	1
ye	1
have	1
supposed	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
have	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
your	1
condemnation	1
Alma	1
6013	1
13	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
suffereth	1
the	1
righteous	1
to	1
be	1
slain	1
that	1
his	1
justice	1
and	1
judgment	1
may	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
wicked	1
therefore	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
are	1
lost	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
slain	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
do	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
6014	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
fear	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
slothfulness	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
slothfulness	1
of	1
our	1
government	1
and	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
neglect	1
towards	1
their	1
brethren	1
yea	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
Alma	1
6015	1
15	1
For	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
which	1
first	1
commenced	1
at	1
our	1
head	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
withstood	1
our	1
enemies	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
gained	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
us	1
Alma	1
6016	1
16	1
Yea	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
war	1
which	1
broke	1
out	1
among	1
ourselves	1
yea	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
these	1
kingmen	1
who	1
caused	1
so	1
much	1
bloodshed	1
among	1
ourselves	1
yea	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
contending	1
among	1
ourselves	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
united	1
our	1
strength	1
as	1
we	1
hitherto	1
have	1
done	1
yea	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
which	1
those	1
kingmen	1
had	1
over	1
us	1
had	1
they	1
been	1
true	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
freedom	1
and	1
united	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
gone	1
forth	1
against	1
our	1
enemies	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
up	1
their	1
swords	1
against	1
us	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
bloodshed	1
among	1
ourselves	1
yea	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
dispersed	1
our	1
enemies	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
Alma	1
6017	1
17	1
But	1
behold	1
now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
coming	1
upon	1
us	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
murdering	1
our	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
yea	1
our	1
women	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
also	1
carrying	1
them	1
away	1
captive	1
causing	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
wickedness	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
seeking	1
for	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
yea	1
even	1
those	1
kingmen	1
Alma	1
6018	1
18	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
say	1
much	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
what	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
seeking	1
for	1
authority	1
We	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
what	1
ye	1
are	1
also	1
traitors	1
to	1
your	1
country	1
Alma	1
6019	1
19	1
Or	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
neglected	1
us	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
security	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
cause	1
food	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
men	1
to	1
strengthen	1
our	1
armies	1
Alma	1
6020	1
20	1
Have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
Yea	1
have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
Have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
the	1
many	1
times	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
6021	1
21	1
Or	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
still	1
deliver	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
sit	1
upon	1
our	1
thrones	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
has	1
provided	1
for	1
us	1
Alma	1
6022	1
22	1
Yea	1
will	1
ye	1
sit	1
in	1
idleness	1
while	1
ye	1
are	1
surrounded	1
with	1
thousands	1
of	1
those	1
yea	1
and	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
who	1
do	1
also	1
sit	1
in	1
idleness	1
while	1
there	1
are	1
thousands	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
who	1
are	1
falling	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
yea	1
wounded	1
and	1
bleeding	1
Alma	1
6023	1
23	1
Do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
look	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
guiltless	1
while	1
ye	1
sit	1
still	1
and	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
inward	1
vessel	1
shall	1
be	1
cleansed	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
outer	1
vessel	1
be	1
cleansed	1
also	1
Alma	1
6024	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
except	1
ye	1
do	1
repent	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
up	1
and	1
doing	1
and	1
send	1
forth	1
food	1
and	1
men	1
unto	1
us	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
Helaman	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
support	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
regained	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
also	1
recover	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
possessions	1
in	1
these	1
parts	1
behold	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
expedient	1
that	1
we	1
contend	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
first	1
cleansed	1
our	1
inward	1
vessel	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
great	1
head	1
of	1
our	1
government	1
Alma	1
6025	1
25	1
And	1
except	1
ye	1
grant	1
mine	1
epistle	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
show	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
true	1
spirit	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
strive	1
to	1
strengthen	1
and	1
fortify	1
our	1
armies	1
and	1
grant	1
unto	1
them	1
food	1
for	1
their	1
support	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
freemen	1
to	1
maintain	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
none	1
other	1
power	1
can	1
operate	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
6026	1
26	1
And	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
and	1
their	1
patience	1
in	1
their	1
tribulations	1
Alma	1
6027	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
freedom	1
yea	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
even	1
a	1
spark	1
of	1
freedom	1
remaining	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
stir	1
up	1
insurrections	1
among	1
you	1
even	1
until	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
desires	1
to	1
usurp	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
shall	1
become	1
extinct	1
Alma	1
6028	1
28	1
Yea	1
behold	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
your	1
power	1
nor	1
your	1
authority	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
God	1
whom	1
I	1
fear	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
commandments	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
take	1
my	1
sword	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
country	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquity	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
suffered	1
so	1
much	1
loss	1
Alma	1
6029	1
29	1
Behold	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
yea	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
now	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1

Behold	1
I	1
wait	1
for	1
assistance	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
do	1
administer	1
unto	1
our	1
relief	1
behold	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
smite	1
you	1
with	1
the	1

insomuch	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
have	1
no	1

For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
and	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
your	1
iniquities	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
righteous	1
people	1
Alma	1
6032	1
32	1
Behold	1
can	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
spare	1
you	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
judgment	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
has	1
caused	1
their	1
hatred	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
redoubled	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
dissented	1
from	1
us	1
while	1
your	1
iniquity	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
your	1
love	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Alma	1
6033	1
33	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
transgress	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
trample	1
them	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
saith	1
unto	1
me	1
If	1
those	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
appointed	1
your	1
governors	1
do	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
6034	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
Moroni	1
am	1
constrained	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
adhere	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
send	1
speedily	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
provisions	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
Helaman	1
Alma	1
6035	1
35	1
And	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
speedily	1
for	1
behold	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
food	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Now	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
Alma	1
6036	1
36	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Moroni	1
your	1
chief	1
captain	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
for	1
power	1
but	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
down	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
for	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
my	1
country	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
close	1
mine	1
epistle	1

61	1
Chapter	1
61	1
Alma	1
611	1
1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
soon	1
after	1
Moroni	1
had	1
sent	1
his	1
epistle	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
governor	1
he	1
received	1
an	1
epistle	1
from	1
Pahoran	1
the	1
chief	1
governor	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
Alma	1
612	1
2	1
I	1
Pahoran	1
who	1
am	1
the	1
chief	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
do	1
send	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Moroni	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
over	1
the	1
army	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Moroni	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
joy	1
in	1
your	1
great	1
afflictions	1
yea	1
it	1
grieves	1
my	1
soul	1
Alma	1
613	1
3	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
joy	1
in	1
your	1
afflictions	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
risen	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
freemen	1
yea	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
risen	1
up	1
are	1
exceedingly	1
numerous	1
Alma	1
614	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
iniquity	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
used	1
great	1
flattery	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
led	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
sore	1
affliction	1
among	1
us	1
they	1
have	1
withheld	1
our	1
provisions	1
and	1
have	1
daunted	1
our	1
freemen	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
Alma	1
615	1
5	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
driven	1
me	1
out	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
with	1
as	1
many	1
men	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
Alma	1
616	1
6	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
flocking	1
to	1
us	1
daily	1
to	1
their	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
their	1
freedom	1
and	1
to	1
avenge	1
our	1
wrongs	1
Alma	1
617	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
insomuch	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
risen	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
against	1
us	1
are	1
set	1
at	1
defiance	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
fear	1
us	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
618	1
8	1
They	1
have	1
got	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
or	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
they	1
have	1
appointed	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
written	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
joined	1
an	1
alliance	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
alliance	1
he	1
hath	1
agreed	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
which	1
maintenance	1
he	1
supposeth	1
will	1
enable	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
conquer	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
placed	1
king	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
conquered	1
under	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
619	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
your	1
epistle	1
you	1
have	1
censured	1
me	1
but	1
it	1
mattereth	1
not	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
angry	1
but	1
do	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
I	1
Pahoran	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
for	1
power	1
save	1
only	1
to	1
retain	1
my	1
judgmentseat	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preserve	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
My	1
soul	1
standeth	1
fast	1
in	1
that	1
liberty	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
free	1
Alma	1
6110	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
will	1
resist	1
wickedness	1
even	1
unto	1
bloodshed	1
We	1
would	1
not	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
stay	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land	1
Alma	1
6111	1
11	1
We	1
would	1
not	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
against	1
us	1
Alma	1
6112	1
12	1
We	1
would	1
subject	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
requisite	1
with	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
command	1
us	1
so	1
to	1
do	1
Alma	1
6113	1
13	1
But	1
behold	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
command	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
subject	1
ourselves	1
to	1
our	1
enemies	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
put	1
our	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
Alma	1
6114	1
14	1
Therefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Moroni	1
let	1
us	1
resist	1
evil	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
evil	1
we	1
cannot	1
resist	1
with	1
our	1
words	1
yea	1
such	1
as	1
rebellions	1
and	1
dissensions	1
let	1
us	1
resist	1
them	1
with	1
our	1
swords	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
retain	1
our	1
freedom	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
privilege	1
of	1
our	1
church	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
Redeemer	1
and	1
our	1
God	1
Alma	1
6115	1
15	1
Therefore	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
speedily	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
your	1
men	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
remainder	1
in	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
power	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
war	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
freedom	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
Alma	1
6116	1
16	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
a	1
few	1
provisions	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
perish	1
until	1
ye	1
can	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
Alma	1
6117	1
17	1
Gather	1
together	1
whatsoever	1
force	1
ye	1
can	1
upon	1
your	1
march	1
hither	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
speedily	1
against	1
those	1
dissenters	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
us	1
Alma	1
6118	1
18	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
obtain	1
more	1
food	1
to	1
send	1
forth	1
unto	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
yea	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
iniquity	1
Alma	1
6119	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
Moroni	1
I	1
do	1
joy	1
in	1
receiving	1
your	1
epistle	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
somewhat	1
worried	1
concerning	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
whether	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
just	1
in	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
our	1
brethren	1
Alma	1
6120	1
20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
against	1
them	1
Alma	1
6121	1
21	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
strengthen	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
fear	1
not	1
for	1
God	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
that	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
free	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
close	1
mine	1
epistle	1
to	1
my	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
62	1
Chapter	1
62	1
Alma	1
621	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
received	1
this	1
epistle	1
his	1
heart	1
did	1
take	1
courage	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
faithfulness	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
also	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
the	1
freedom	1
and	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
Alma	1
622	1
2	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
also	1
mourn	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
driven	1
Pahoran	1
from	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
yea	1
in	1
fine	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
rebelled	1
against	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
623	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
and	1
gave	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
command	1
over	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
march	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
Alma	1
624	1
4	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
raise	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
liberty	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
place	1
he	1
did	1
enter	1
and	1
gained	1
whatsoever	1
force	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
march	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
Alma	1
625	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thousands	1
did	1
flock	1
unto	1
his	1
standard	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
swords	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
freedom	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
bondage	1
Alma	1
626	1
6	1
And	1
thus	1
when	1
Moroni	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
whatsoever	1
men	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
march	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gideon	1
and	1
uniting	1
his	1
forces	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
even	1
stronger	1
than	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Pachus	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
those	1
dissenters	1
who	1
had	1
driven	1
the	1
freemen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
627	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
did	1
meet	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Pachus	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
Alma	1
628	1
8	1
And	1
behold	1
Pachus	1
was	1
slain	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
was	1
restored	1
to	1
his	1
judgmentseat	1
Alma	1
629	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Pachus	1
received	1
their	1
trial	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
kingmen	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
executed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
yea	1
those	1
men	1
of	1
Pachus	1
and	1
those	1
kingmen	1
whosoever	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
but	1
would	1
fight	1
against	1
it	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
Alma	1
6210	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
this	1
law	1
should	1
be	1
strictly	1
observed	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
yea	1
and	1
whosoever	1
was	1
found	1
denying	1
their	1
freedom	1
was	1
speedily	1
executed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
Alma	1
6211	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
having	1
restored	1
peace	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
among	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
having	1
inflicted	1
death	1
upon	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
true	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
freedom	1
Alma	1
6212	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Moroni	1
immediately	1
caused	1
that	1
provisions	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
and	1
also	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
unto	1
Helaman	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
preserving	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
6213	1
13	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
caused	1
that	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
sufficient	1
quantity	1
of	1
food	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
fortify	1
the	1
land	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
6214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
leaving	1
a	1
large	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
took	1
their	1
march	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
being	1
determined	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
Alma	1
6215	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
marching	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
slew	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
provisions	1
and	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
Alma	1
6216	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
them	1
they	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
6217	1
17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
this	1
covenant	1
they	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
four	1
thousand	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
slain	1
Alma	1
6218	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
away	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
march	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
they	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
which	1
is	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
Alma	1
6219	1
19	1
Now	1
Moroni	1
was	1
desirous	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
plains	1
but	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
knowing	1
of	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
courage	1
and	1
beholding	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
numbers	1
therefore	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
Alma	1
6220	1
20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
Moroni	1
went	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
in	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
camp	1
with	1
their	1
army	1
Alma	1
6221	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
asleep	1
And	1
now	1
Moroni	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
prepare	1
in	1
haste	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
ladders	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
Alma	1
6222	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
men	1
should	1
march	1
forth	1
and	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
let	1
themselves	1
down	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
yea	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
where	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
camp	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
Alma	1
6223	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
let	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
their	1
strong	1
cords	1
and	1
their	1
ladders	1
thus	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
came	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Alma	1
6224	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
awoke	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moroni	1
were	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
they	1
were	1
affrighted	1
exceedingly	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
pass	1
Alma	1
6225	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Moroni	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fleeing	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
his	1
men	1
should	1
march	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
slew	1
many	1
and	1
surrounded	1
many	1
others	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
prisoners	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moroni	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Alma	1
6226	1
26	1
Thus	1
had	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Pahoran	1
obtained	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
without	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
one	1
soul	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
Alma	1
6227	1
27	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
were	1
prisoners	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
become	1
a	1
free	1
people	1
Alma	1
6228	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
desirous	1
unto	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
granted	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desires	1
Alma	1
6229	1
29	1
Therefore	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
join	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
labor	1
exceedingly	1
tilling	1
the	1
ground	1
raising	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Nephites	1
relieved	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
burden	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
relieved	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Alma	1
6230	1
30	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
having	1
taken	1
many	1
prisoners	1
which	1
did	1
reduce	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
having	1
regained	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
which	1
did	1
strengthen	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
exceedingly	1
therefore	1
Moroni	1
went	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephihah	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Lehi	1
Alma	1
6231	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
saw	1
that	1
Moroni	1
was	1
coming	1
against	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
frightened	1
and	1
fled	1
before	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
6232	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
fled	1
from	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
even	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Alma	1
6233	1
33	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
all	1
gathered	1
together	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moroni	1
Now	1
Ammoron	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
them	1
Alma	1
6234	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
and	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Teancum	1
did	1
encamp	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moroni	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
Alma	1
6235	1
35	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
encamp	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
also	1
were	1
weary	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
march	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
resolve	1
upon	1
any	1
stratagem	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
Teancum	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
with	1
Ammoron	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
that	1
Ammoron	1
and	1
Amalickiah	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
and	1
lasting	1
war	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
war	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
yea	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
famine	1
Alma	1
6236	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Teancum	1
in	1
his	1
anger	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
let	1
himself	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
cord	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
find	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
cast	1
a	1
javelin	1
at	1
him	1
which	1
did	1
pierce	1
him	1
near	1
the	1
heart	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
awaken	1
his	1
servants	1
before	1
he	1
died	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
pursue	1
Teancum	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
Alma	1
6237	1
37	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Lehi	1
and	1
Moroni	1
knew	1
that	1
Teancum	1
was	1
dead	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
valiantly	1
for	1
his	1
country	1
yea	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
very	1
many	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
afflictions	1
But	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
Alma	1
6238	1
38	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
marched	1
forth	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
6239	1
39	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
wars	1
and	1
bloodsheds	1
and	1
famine	1
and	1
affliction	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
Alma	1
6240	1
40	1
And	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
murders	1
and	1
contentions	1
and	1
dissensions	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
nevertheless	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
sake	1
yea	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
they	1
were	1
spared	1
Alma	1
6241	1
41	1
But	1
behold	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
many	1
had	1
become	1
hardened	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
softened	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
afflictions	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
God	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
humility	1
Alma	1
6242	1
42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
Moroni	1
had	1
fortified	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
were	1
most	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
also	1
Helaman	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
peace	1
established	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
6243	1
43	1
And	1
Moroni	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
his	1
armies	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Moronihah	1
and	1
he	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
spend	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
in	1
peace	1
Alma	1
6244	1
44	1
And	1
Pahoran	1
did	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
Helaman	1
did	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
expedient	1
that	1
a	1
regulation	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
Alma	1
6245	1
45	1
Therefore	1
Helaman	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
declare	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
much	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
convincing	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
which	1
did	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Alma	1
6246	1
46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
establish	1
again	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
6247	1
47	1
Yea	1
and	1
regulations	1
were	1
made	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
And	1
their	1
judges	1
and	1
their	1
chief	1
judges	1
were	1
chosen	1
Alma	1
6248	1
48	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
multiply	1
and	1
to	1
wax	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
Alma	1
6249	1
49	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
riches	1
or	1
their	1
strength	1
or	1
their	1
prosperity	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
eyes	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
slow	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
exceedingly	1
before	1
him	1
Alma	1
6250	1
50	1
Yea	1
they	1
did	1
remember	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
from	1
death	1
and	1
from	1
bonds	1
and	1
from	1
prisons	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
Alma	1
6251	1
51	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
continually	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
bless	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
wax	1
strong	1
and	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Alma	1
6252	1
52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
And	1
Helaman	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1

1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1

year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
Shiblon	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
those	1

which	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
unto	1

by	1
Alma	1
Alma	1

2	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
walk	1
uprightly	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
continually	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
his	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
did	1
his	1
brother	1
Alma	1
633	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moroni	1
died	1
also	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Alma	1
634	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
company	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
five	1
thousand	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
men	1
with	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
northward	1
Alma	1
635	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Hagoth	1
he	1
being	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
curious	1
man	1
therefore	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
large	1
ship	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
by	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
and	1
launched	1
it	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
by	1
the	1
narrow	1
neck	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
636	1
6	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
did	1
enter	1
therein	1
and	1
did	1
sail	1
forth	1
with	1
much	1
provisions	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
course	1
northward	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
Alma	1
637	1
7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
this	1
man	1
built	1
other	1
ships	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
ship	1
did	1
also	1
return	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
people	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
much	1
provisions	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Alma	1
638	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
more	1
And	1
we	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
one	1
other	1
ship	1
also	1
did	1
sail	1
forth	1
and	1
whither	1
she	1
did	1
go	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
Alma	1
639	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
Alma	1
6310	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Shiblon	1
died	1
also	1
and	1
Corianton	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
to	1
carry	1
forth	1
provisions	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
that	1
land	1
Alma	1
6311	1
11	1
Therefore	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
for	1
Shiblon	1
to	1
confer	1
those	1
sacred	1
things	1
before	1
his	1
death	1
upon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Helaman	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Helaman	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Alma	1
6312	1
12	1
Now	1
behold	1
all	1
those	1
engravings	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
Helaman	1
were	1
written	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
those	1
parts	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
commanded	1
by	1
Alma	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
Alma	1
6313	1
13	1
Nevertheless	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
sacred	1
and	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
one	1
generation	1
to	1
another	1
therefore	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
conferred	1
upon	1
Helaman	1
before	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Shiblon	1
Alma	1
6314	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
dissenters	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
stirred	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Alma	1
6315	1
15	1
And	1
also	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
year	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
numerous	1
army	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Moronihah	1
or	1
against	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Moronihah	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
beaten	1
and	1
driven	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
suffering	1
great	1
loss	1
Alma	1
6316	1
16	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Alma	1
6317	1
17	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
Helaman	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
also	1

who	1
was	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
fortieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
serious	1
difficulty	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
12	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
Pahoran	1
had	1
died	1
and	1
gone	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
therefore	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
serious	1
contention	1
concerning	1
who	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
among	1
the	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
Helaman	1
13	1
3	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
names	1
who	1
did	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
who	1
did	1
also	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
contend	1
Pahoran	1
Paanchi	1
and	1
Pacumeni	1
Helaman	1
14	1
4	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
did	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
three	1
divisions	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
15	1
5	1
Nevertheless	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Pahoran	1
was	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
a	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Pacumeni	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
obtain	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
he	1
did	1
unite	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
17	1
7	1
But	1
behold	1
Paanchi	1
and	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
governor	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
wroth	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
flatter	1
away	1
those	1
people	1
to	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
Helaman	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
was	1
tried	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
condemned	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
up	1
in	1
rebellion	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
when	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
governor	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
condemned	1
unto	1
death	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
one	1
Kishkumen	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
and	1
murdered	1
Pahoran	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
Helaman	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Pahoran	1
but	1
behold	1
so	1
speedy	1
was	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
Kishkumen	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
overtake	1
him	1
Helaman	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
sent	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
yea	1
swearing	1
by	1
their	1
everlasting	1
Maker	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
Kishkumen	1
had	1
murdered	1
Pahoran	1
Helaman	1
112	1
12	1
Therefore	1
Kishkumen	1
was	1
not	1
known	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
disguise	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
murdered	1
Pahoran	1
And	1
Kishkumen	1
and	1
his	1
band	1
who	1
had	1
covenanted	1
with	1
him	1
did	1
mingle	1
themselves	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
but	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
found	1
were	1
condemned	1
unto	1
death	1
Helaman	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
Pacumeni	1
was	1
appointed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
chief	1
judge	1
and	1
a	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Pahoran	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
right	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
fortieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
an	1
end	1
Helaman	1
114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
an	1
innumerable	1
army	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
armed	1
them	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
cimeters	1
and	1
with	1
bows	1
and	1
with	1
arrows	1
and	1
with	1
headplates	1
and	1
with	1
breastplates	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
shields	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Helaman	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
pitch	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dissenter	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
Helaman	1
116	1
16	1
Therefore	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tubaloth	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammoron	1
supposing	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
being	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
could	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
with	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
wisdom	1
insomuch	1
that	1
by	1
sending	1
him	1
forth	1
he	1
should	1
gain	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
117	1
17	1
Therefore	1
he	1
did	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
armies	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
appoint	1
Coriantumr	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
leader	1
and	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
march	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
contention	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
kept	1
sufficient	1
guards	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
durst	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
to	1
attack	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Zarahemla	1
Helaman	1
119	1
19	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
numerous	1
host	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
their	1
march	1
was	1
with	1
such	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
speed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
their	1
armies	1
Helaman	1
120	1
20	1
Therefore	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
watch	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
slay	1
every	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
oppose	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
Helaman	1
121	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Pacumeni	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
did	1
flee	1
before	1
Coriantumr	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
smite	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Pacumeni	1
Helaman	1
122	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Coriantumr	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
fled	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
hold	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
his	1
heart	1
took	1
courage	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
123	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
tarry	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
army	1
even	1
towards	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Bountiful	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
determination	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
cut	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
obtain	1
the	1
north	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
124	1
24	1
And	1
supposing	1
that	1
their	1
greatest	1
strength	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
giving	1
them	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
small	1
bodies	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
they	1
did	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
125	1
25	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
march	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
through	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
gave	1
Moronihah	1
great	1
advantage	1
over	1
them	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
Helaman	1
126	1
26	1
For	1
behold	1
Moronihah	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
durst	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
attack	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
hitherto	1
done	1
therefore	1
Moronihah	1
had	1
caused	1
that	1
their	1
strong	1
armies	1
should	1
maintain	1
those	1
parts	1
round	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
borders	1
Helaman	1
127	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
not	1
frightened	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desire	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
capital	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
were	1
marching	1
through	1
the	1
most	1
capital	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
slaying	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
both	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
many	1
cities	1
and	1
of	1
many	1
strongholds	1
Helaman	1
128	1
28	1
But	1
when	1
Moronihah	1
had	1
discovered	1
this	1
he	1
immediately	1
sent	1
forth	1
Lehi	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
head	1
them	1
before	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
Helaman	1
129	1
29	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
head	1
them	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
battle	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
retreat	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Helaman	1
130	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moronihah	1
did	1
head	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
retreat	1
and	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
battle	1
insomuch	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
bloody	1
battle	1
yea	1
many	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
Coriantumr	1
was	1
also	1
found	1
Helaman	1
131	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
retreat	1
either	1
way	1
neither	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
surrounded	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
132	1
32	1
And	1
thus	1
had	1
Coriantumr	1
plunged	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
slain	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
yield	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
133	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Moronihah	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
again	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
peace	1
Helaman	1
134	1
34	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
2	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Helaman	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
after	1
Moronihah	1
had	1
established	1
again	1
peace	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
therefore	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
contention	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
who	1
should	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
Helaman	1
22	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Helaman	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Helaman	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
23	1
3	1
But	1
behold	1
Kishkumen	1
who	1
had	1
murdered	1
Pahoran	1
did	1
lay	1
wait	1
to	1
destroy	1
Helaman	1
also	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
upheld	1
by	1
his	1
band	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
know	1
his	1
wickedness	1
Helaman	1
24	1
4	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Gadianton	1
who	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
expert	1
in	1
many	1
words	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
craft	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
secret	1
work	1
of	1
murder	1
and	1
of	1
robbery	1
therefore	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
Kishkumen	1
Helaman	1
25	1
5	1
Therefore	1
he	1
did	1
flatter	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
Kishkumen	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
place	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
band	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
Kishkumen	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
Helaman	1
Helaman	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
towards	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
to	1
destroy	1
Helaman	1
behold	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Helaman	1
having	1
been	1
out	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
having	1
obtained	1
through	1
disguise	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
those	1
plans	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
by	1
this	1
band	1
to	1
destroy	1
Helaman	1
Helaman	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
met	1
Kishkumen	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
therefore	1
Kishkumen	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
desire	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
conduct	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
murder	1
Helaman	1
Helaman	1
28	1
8	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Helaman	1
had	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Kishkumen	1
and	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
object	1
to	1
murder	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
band	1
to	1
murder	1
and	1
to	1
rob	1
and	1
to	1
gain	1
power	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
their	1
secret	1
plan	1
and	1
their	1
combination	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Helaman	1
said	1
unto	1
Kishkumen	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
Helaman	1
29	1
9	1
Now	1
this	1
did	1
please	1
Kishkumen	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
suppose	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
accomplish	1
his	1
design	1
but	1
behold	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Helaman	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
did	1
stab	1
Kishkumen	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
dead	1
without	1
a	1
groan	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
Helaman	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
and	1
done	1
Helaman	1
210	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Helaman	1
did	1
send	1
forth	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
secret	1
murderers	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
executed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
Helaman	1
211	1
11	1
But	1
behold	1
when	1
Gadianton	1
had	1
found	1
that	1
Kishkumen	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
he	1
feared	1
lest	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
therefore	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
band	1
should	1
follow	1
him	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
flight	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
a	1
secret	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
thus	1
when	1
Helaman	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
they	1
could	1
nowhere	1
be	1
found	1
Helaman	1
212	1
12	1
And	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
Gadianton	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
hereafter	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
213	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
Gadianton	1
did	1
prove	1
the	1
overthrow	1
yea	1
almost	1
the	1
entire	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
214	1
14	1
Behold	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Helaman	1
but	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
all	1
the	1
account	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
Helaman	1
3	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Helaman	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
pride	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
did	1
cause	1
some	1
little	1
dissensions	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
affairs	1
were	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
ending	1
of	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
Helaman	1
32	1
2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
much	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
Helaman	1
33	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
sixth	1
yea	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
contention	1
and	1
many	1
dissensions	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
many	1
who	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
34	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
travel	1
to	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
distance	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
large	1
bodies	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
many	1
rivers	1
Helaman	1
35	1
5	1
Yea	1
and	1
even	1
they	1
did	1
spread	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
whatever	1
parts	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
rendered	1
desolate	1
and	1
without	1
timber	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
had	1
before	1
inherited	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
36	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
desolate	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
timber	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
before	1
inhabited	1
the	1
land	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
desolate	1
Helaman	1
37	1
7	1
And	1
there	1
being	1
but	1
little	1
timber	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
went	1
forth	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
expert	1
in	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
cement	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
build	1
houses	1
of	1
cement	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
dwell	1
Helaman	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
multiply	1
and	1
spread	1
and	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
and	1
did	1
spread	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
south	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
north	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
east	1
Helaman	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
did	1
dwell	1
in	1
tents	1
and	1
in	1
houses	1
of	1
cement	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
suffer	1
whatsoever	1
tree	1
should	1
spring	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
grow	1
up	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
timber	1
to	1
build	1
their	1
houses	1
yea	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
their	1
temples	1
and	1
their	1
synagogues	1
and	1
their	1
sanctuaries	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
buildings	1
Helaman	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
timber	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
scarce	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
they	1
did	1
send	1
forth	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
shipping	1
Helaman	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
enable	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
build	1
many	1
cities	1
both	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
cement	1
Helaman	1
312	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Ammon	1
who	1
were	1
Lamanites	1
by	1
birth	1
did	1
also	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
this	1
land	1
Helaman	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
records	1
kept	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
particular	1
and	1
very	1
large	1
concerning	1
them	1
Helaman	1
314	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
yea	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
their	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
and	1
dissensions	1
and	1
their	1
preaching	1
and	1
their	1
prophecies	1
and	1
their	1
shipping	1
and	1
their	1
building	1
of	1
ships	1
and	1
their	1
building	1
of	1
temples	1
and	1
of	1
synagogues	1
and	1
their	1
sanctuaries	1
and	1
their	1
righteousness	1
and	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
murders	1
and	1
their	1
robbings	1
and	1
their	1
plundering	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
whoredoms	1
cannot	1
be	1
contained	1
in	1
this	1
work	1
Helaman	1
315	1
15	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
books	1
and	1
many	1
records	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
chiefly	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
316	1
16	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1
one	1
generation	1
to	1
another	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
transgression	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
murdered	1
plundered	1
and	1
hunted	1
and	1
driven	1
forth	1
and	1
slain	1
and	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
mixed	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
called	1
the	1
Nephites	1
becoming	1
wicked	1
and	1
wild	1
and	1
ferocious	1
yea	1
even	1
becoming	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
mine	1
account	1
therefore	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
had	1
passed	1
after	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
great	1
contentions	1
and	1
disturbances	1
and	1
wars	1
and	1
dissensions	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
318	1
18	1
The	1
forty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
ended	1
Helaman	1
319	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
great	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
Helaman	1
320	1
20	1
Nevertheless	1
Helaman	1
did	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
with	1
justice	1
and	1
equity	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
and	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
continually	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
sons	1
He	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
eldest	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
youngest	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lehi	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
began	1
to	1
cease	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
degree	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
323	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
secret	1
combinations	1
which	1
Gadianton	1
the	1
robber	1
had	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
settled	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
were	1
not	1
known	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
government	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
prosperity	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
thousands	1
who	1
did	1
join	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
were	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Helaman	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
the	1
blessings	1
which	1
were	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
high	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
teachers	1
were	1
themselves	1
astonished	1
beyond	1
measure	1
Helaman	1
326	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
prosper	1
unto	1
the	1
baptizing	1
and	1
uniting	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
many	1
souls	1
yea	1
even	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
Helaman	1
327	1
27	1
Thus	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
merciful	1
unto	1
all	1
who	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
holy	1
name	1
Helaman	1
328	1
28	1
Yea	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
open	1
unto	1
all	1
even	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
329	1
29	1
Yea	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
whosoever	1
will	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
quick	1
and	1
powerful	1
which	1
shall	1
divide	1
asunder	1
all	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
the	1
snares	1
and	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
lead	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
and	1
narrow	1
course	1
across	1
that	1
everlasting	1
gulf	1
of	1
misery	1
which	1
is	1
prepared	1
to	1
engulf	1
the	1
wicked	1
Helaman	1
330	1
30	1
And	1
land	1
their	1

their	1
immortal	1
souls	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1

to	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
and	1
with	1
Jacob	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
holy	1
fathers	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out	1
Helaman	1
331	1
31	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
regions	1
round	1
about	1
even	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Helaman	1
332	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
forty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
there	1
was	1
continual	1
peace	1
and	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
333	1
33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
also	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
pride	1
which	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
churchnot	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
professed	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
334	1
34	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
pride	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
persecution	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
evil	1
which	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
more	1
humble	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
suffer	1
great	1
persecutions	1
and	1
to	1
wade	1
through	1
much	1
affliction	1
Helaman	1
335	1
35	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
fast	1
and	1
pray	1
oft	1
and	1
did	1
wax	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
in	1
their	1
humility	1
and	1
firmer	1
and	1
firmer	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
the	1
filling	1
their	1
souls	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
consolation	1
yea	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
purifying	1
and	1
the	1
sanctification	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
which	1
sanctification	1
cometh	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
yielding	1
their	1
hearts	1
unto	1
God	1
Helaman	1
336	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
ended	1
in	1
peace	1
also	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
pride	1
which	1
had	1
gotten	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
riches	1
and	1
their	1
prosperity	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
grow	1
upon	1
them	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
Helaman	1

And	1
it	1

Helaman	1
died	1
and	1
his	1

Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
fill	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
with	1
justice	1
and	1
equity	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1

and	1
did	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1

1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
dissensions	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
contention	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
bloodshed	1
Helaman	1
42	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
rebellious	1
part	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
endeavor	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
but	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
afraid	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
those	1
dissenters	1
Helaman	1
44	1

But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
were	1
dissenters	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
succeeded	1
with	1
those	1
others	1
in	1
stirring	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
year	1
preparing	1
for	1
war	1
Helaman	1
45	1
5	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
commence	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
death	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
they	1
succeeded	1
in	1
obtaining	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
Helaman	1
46	1
6	1
And	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Moronihah	1
were	1
driven	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Bountiful	1
Helaman	1
47	1
7	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
did	1
fortify	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
sea	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
east	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
days	1
journey	1
for	1
a	1
Nephite	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
fortified	1
and	1
stationed	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
north	1
country	1
Helaman	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
those	1
dissenters	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
obtained	1
all	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1
eighth	1
and	1
ninth	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Moronihah	1
did	1
succeed	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
in	1
obtaining	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
they	1
regained	1
many	1
cities	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
they	1
succeeded	1
in	1
regaining	1
even	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
possessions	1
Helaman	1
411	1
11	1
Now	1
this	1
great	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
slaughter	1
which	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
happened	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abomination	1
which	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
among	1
those	1
also	1
who	1
professed	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
yea	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
oppression	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
withholding	1
their	1
food	1
from	1
the	1
hungry	1
withholding	1
their	1
clothing	1
from	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
smiting	1
their	1
humble	1
brethren	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek	1
making	1
a	1
mock	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sacred	1
denying	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
of	1
revelation	1
murdering	1
plundering	1
lying	1
stealing	1
committing	1
adultery	1
rising	1
up	1
in	1
great	1
contentions	1
and	1
deserting	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
413	1
13	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
their	1
great	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
boastings	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
prosper	1
but	1
were	1
afflicted	1
and	1
smitten	1
and	1
driven	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
possession	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
their	1
lands	1
Helaman	1
414	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
Moronihah	1
did	1
preach	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
also	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Helaman	1
did	1
preach	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
yea	1
and	1
did	1
prophesy	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
what	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
Helaman	1
415	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
and	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
they	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
prosper	1
Helaman	1
416	1
16	1
For	1
when	1
Moronihah	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
he	1
did	1
venture	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
forth	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
and	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
regained	1
the	1
onehalf	1
of	1
their	1
property	1
and	1
the	1
onehalf	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
lands	1
Helaman	1
417	1
17	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
418	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
Moronihah	1
could	1
obtain	1
no	1
more	1
possessions	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
419	1
19	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
abandon	1
their	1
design	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
for	1
so	1
numerous	1
were	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
obtain	1
more	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
therefore	1
Moronihah	1
did	1
employ	1
all	1
his	1
armies	1
in	1
maintaining	1
those	1
parts	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
Helaman	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
in	1
great	1
fear	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
overpowered	1
and	1
trodden	1
down	1
and	1
slain	1
and	1
destroyed	1
Helaman	1
421	1
21	1
Yea	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
at	1
naught	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
422	1
22	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
altered	1
and	1
trampled	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
laws	1
had	1
become	1
corrupted	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
wicked	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
wicked	1
even	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
423	1
23	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
the	1
church	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
dwindle	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
stare	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
Helaman	1
424	1
24	1
And	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
weak	1
like	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
preserve	1
them	1
yea	1
it	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
them	1
because	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
doth	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
unholy	1
temples	1
Helaman	1
425	1
25	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
cease	1
to	1
preserve	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
miraculous	1
and	1
matchless	1
power	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
unbelief	1
and	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
they	1
and	1
except	1
they	1
should	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
they	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
perish	1
Helaman	1
426	1
26	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
was	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
their	1
strength	1
even	1
man	1
for	1
man	1
And	1
thus	1
had	1
they	1
fallen	1
into	1
this	1
great	1
transgression	1
yea	1
thus	1
had	1
they	1
become	1
weak	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgression	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
not	1
many	1
years	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
in	1
this	1

behold	1
Nephi	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1

to	1
a	1

whose	1
name	1
was	1
Cezoram	1
Helaman	1
52	1
2	1
For	1
as	1
their	1
laws	1
and	1
their	1
governments	1
were	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
chose	1
evil	1
were	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
they	1
who	1
chose	1
good	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
ripening	1
for	1
destruction	1
for	1
the	1
laws	1
had	1
become	1
corrupted	1
Helaman	1
53	1
3	1
Yea	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
nor	1
justice	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
their	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
had	1
become	1
weary	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
he	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
all	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Lehi	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
Helaman	1
55	1
5	1
For	1
they	1
remembered	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
their	1
father	1
Helaman	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
Helaman	1
56	1
6	1
Behold	1
my	1
sons	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
declare	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
these	1
words	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
remember	1
your	1
names	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
them	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
remember	1
them	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
remember	1
their	1
works	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
and	1
also	1
written	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
Helaman	1
57	1
7	1
Therefore	1
my	1
sons	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
also	1
written	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
and	1
written	1
of	1
them	1
Helaman	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
sons	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
more	1
to	1
desire	1
of	1
you	1
which	1
desire	1
is	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
boast	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
a	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven	1
yea	1
which	1
is	1
eternal	1
and	1
which	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away	1
yea	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
that	1
precious	1
gift	1
of	1
eternal	1
life	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
hath	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
our	1
fathers	1
Helaman	1
59	1
9	1
O	1
remember	1
remember	1
my	1
sons	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
king	1
Benjamin	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
remember	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
nor	1
means	1
whereby	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
only	1
through	1
the	1
atoning	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
shall	1
come	1
yea	1
remember	1
that	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
redeem	1
the	1
world	1
Helaman	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
remember	1
also	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Amulek	1
spake	1
unto	1
Zeezrom	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Ammonihah	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
surely	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
his	1
people	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
but	1
to	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
sins	1
Helaman	1
511	1
11	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
power	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
to	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
sins	1
because	1
of	1
repentance	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angels	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
repentance	1
which	1
bringeth	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
unto	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
Helaman	1
512	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
sons	1
remember	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
our	1
Redeemer	1
who	1
is	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
build	1
your	1
foundation	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
his	1
mighty	1
winds	1
yea	1
his	1
shafts	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
yea	1
when	1
all	1
his	1
hail	1
and	1
his	1
mighty	1
storm	1
shall	1
beat	1
upon	1
you	1
it	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
to	1
drag	1
you	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
gulf	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
endless	1
wo	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
upon	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
built	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
sure	1
foundation	1
a	1
foundation	1
whereon	1
if	1
men	1
build	1
they	1
cannot	1
fall	1
Helaman	1
513	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Helaman	1
taught	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
Helaman	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
remember	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
keeping	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
city	1
Bountiful	1
Helaman	1
515	1
15	1
And	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gid	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gid	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Mulek	1
Helaman	1
516	1
16	1
And	1
even	1
from	1
one	1
city	1
to	1
another	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
517	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
confound	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
dissenters	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
confess	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
were	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
immediately	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
endeavor	1
to	1
repair	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
wrongs	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
Helaman	1
518	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
with	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
speak	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
had	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
speak	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
519	1
19	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
to	1
the	1
convincing	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
eight	1
thousand	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
Helaman	1
520	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
did	1
proceed	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
521	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
by	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
prison	1
in	1
which	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
cast	1
by	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Limhi	1
Helaman	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
many	1
days	1
without	1
food	1
behold	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
slay	1
them	1
Helaman	1
523	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
fire	1
even	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
fear	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
burned	1
Nevertheless	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
were	1
not	1
burned	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
burned	1
Helaman	1
524	1
24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
burned	1
them	1
not	1
their	1
hearts	1
did	1
take	1
courage	1
Helaman	1
525	1
25	1
For	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
durst	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
them	1
neither	1
durst	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
them	1
but	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
struck	1
dumb	1
with	1
amazement	1
Helaman	1
526	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
did	1
stand	1
forth	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Fear	1
not	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
has	1
shown	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
marvelous	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
is	1
shown	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
lay	1
your	1
hands	1
on	1
us	1
to	1
slay	1
us	1
Helaman	1
527	1
27	1
And	1
behold	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
did	1
shake	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
Nephites	1
who	1
were	1
dissenters	1
Helaman	1
528	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
overshadowed	1
with	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
an	1
awful	1
solemn	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
Helaman	1
529	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
above	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
saying	1
Repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
and	1
seek	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
servants	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
declare	1
good	1
tidings	1
Helaman	1
530	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
voice	1
and	1
beheld	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
thunder	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
tumultuous	1
noise	1
but	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
still	1
voice	1
of	1
perfect	1
mildness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
pierce	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
soul	1
Helaman	1
531	1
31	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
behold	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
trembled	1
again	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
which	1
had	1
overshadowed	1
them	1
did	1
not	1
disperse	1
Helaman	1
532	1
32	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
again	1
saying	1
Repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
seek	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
servants	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
trembled	1
Helaman	1
533	1
33	1
And	1
also	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
marvelous	1
words	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
uttered	1
by	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
did	1
tremble	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
divide	1
asunder	1
Helaman	1
534	1
34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
not	1
flee	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
which	1
did	1
overshadow	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
immovable	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
which	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Helaman	1
535	1
35	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Nephite	1
by	1
birth	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
had	1
dissented	1
from	1
them	1
Helaman	1
536	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
him	1
about	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
saw	1
through	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
shine	1
exceedingly	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
angels	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
lift	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
as	1
if	1
talking	1
or	1
lifting	1
their	1
voices	1
to	1
some	1
being	1
whom	1
they	1
beheld	1
Helaman	1
537	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
turn	1
and	1
look	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
power	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
turn	1
and	1
look	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
behold	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
Helaman	1
538	1
38	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
Behold	1
what	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
mean	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
with	1
whom	1
these	1
men	1
do	1
converse	1
Helaman	1
539	1
39	1
Now	1
the	1
mans	1
name	1
was	1
Aminadab	1
And	1
Aminadab	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
They	1
do	1
converse	1
with	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
540	1
40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
that	1
this	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
may	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
overshadowing	1
us	1
Helaman	1
541	1
41	1
And	1
Aminadab	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
You	1
must	1
repent	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
even	1
until	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
who	1
was	1
taught	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
and	1
Zeezrom	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
this	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
shall	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
overshadowing	1
you	1
Helaman	1
542	1
42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
shaken	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
was	1
dispersed	1
Helaman	1
543	1
43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
eyes	1
about	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
darkness	1
was	1
dispersed	1
from	1
overshadowing	1
them	1
behold	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
yea	1
every	1
soul	1
by	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
Helaman	1
544	1
44	1
And	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
encircled	1
about	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire	1
yet	1
it	1
did	1
harm	1
them	1
not	1
neither	1
did	1
it	1
take	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
that	1
joy	1
which	1
is	1
unspeakable	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
glory	1
Helaman	1
545	1
45	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
and	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
speak	1
forth	1
marvelous	1
words	1
Helaman	1
546	1
46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
unto	1
them	1
yea	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
whisper	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
547	1
47	1
Peace	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
my	1
Well	1
Beloved	1
who	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Helaman	1
548	1
48	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
they	1
cast	1
up	1
their	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
behold	1
from	1
whence	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
open	1
and	1
angels	1
came	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
549	1
49	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
souls	1
who	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
bidden	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
marvel	1
not	1
neither	1
should	1
they	1
doubt	1
Helaman	1
550	1
50	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
declaring	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
regions	1
round	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
evidences	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
Helaman	1
551	1
51	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
convinced	1
did	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
hatred	1
and	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
Helaman	1
552	1
52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
yield	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
possession	1
Helaman	1

Chapter	1

Helaman	1
61	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
their	1
righteousness	1
did	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
firmness	1
and	1
their	1
steadiness	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
Helaman	1
62	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
hardened	1
and	1
impenitent	1
and	1
grossly	1
wicked	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
reject	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
preaching	1
and	1
prophesying	1
which	1
did	1
come	1
among	1
them	1
Helaman	1
63	1
3	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
did	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
conversion	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
yea	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
established	1
among	1
them	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
fellowship	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
did	1
rejoice	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
did	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
Helaman	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
did	1
declare	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
conversion	1
and	1
did	1
exhort	1
them	1
to	1
faith	1
and	1
repentance	1
Helaman	1
65	1
5	1
Yea	1
and	1
many	1
did	1
preach	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
unto	1
the	1
bringing	1
down	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
humility	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
humble	1
followers	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
Helaman	1
66	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
and	1
also	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
Helaman	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
go	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
they	1
would	1
whether	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
or	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
68	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
also	1
go	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
would	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
or	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
free	1
intercourse	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
to	1
buy	1
and	1
to	1
sell	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desire	1
Helaman	1
69	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
both	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
an	1
exceeding	1
plenty	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
metals	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
south	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
north	1
Helaman	1
610	1
10	1
Now	1
the	1
land	1
south	1
was	1
called	1
Lehi	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
north	1
was	1
called	1
Mulek	1
which	1
was	1
after	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
bring	1
Mulek	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
north	1
and	1
Lehi	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
south	1
Helaman	1
611	1
11	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
both	1
these	1
lands	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
precious	1
ore	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
curious	1
workmen	1
who	1
did	1
work	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
ore	1
and	1
did	1
refine	1
it	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
become	1
rich	1
Helaman	1
612	1
12	1
They	1
did	1
raise	1
grain	1
in	1
abundance	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
flourish	1
exceedingly	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
multiply	1
and	1
wax	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
raise	1
many	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
yea	1
many	1
fatlings	1
Helaman	1
613	1
13	1
Behold	1
their	1
women	1
did	1
toil	1
and	1
spin	1
and	1
did	1
make	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
cloth	1
of	1
finetwined	1
linen	1
and	1
cloth	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
to	1
clothe	1
their	1
nakedness	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
in	1
peace	1
Helaman	1
614	1
14	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
yea	1
much	1
preaching	1
and	1
many	1
prophecies	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
And	1
thus	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
Helaman	1
615	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
behold	1
Cezoram	1
was	1
murdered	1
by	1
an	1
unknown	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
was	1
also	1
murdered	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
Helaman	1
616	1
16	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
exceedingly	1
wicked	1
again	1
Helaman	1
617	1
17	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
blessed	1
them	1
so	1
long	1
with	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
to	1
wars	1
nor	1
to	1
bloodshed	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
set	1
their	1
hearts	1
upon	1
their	1
riches	1
yea	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
seek	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
one	1
above	1
another	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
commit	1
secret	1
murders	1
and	1
to	1
rob	1
and	1
to	1
plunder	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
gain	1
Helaman	1
618	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
those	1
murderers	1
and	1
plunderers	1
were	1
a	1
band	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
formed	1
by	1
Kishkumen	1
and	1
Gadianton	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
of	1
Gadiantons	1
band	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
numerous	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
Gadiantons	1
robbers	1
and	1
murderers	1
Helaman	1
619	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
did	1
murder	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
Cezoram	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
found	1
Helaman	1
620	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
robbers	1
among	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
use	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
621	1
21	1
But	1
behold	1
Satan	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
unite	1
with	1
those	1
bands	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
covenants	1
and	1
their	1
oaths	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
protect	1
and	1
preserve	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
difficult	1
circumstances	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
suffer	1
for	1
their	1
murders	1
and	1
their	1
plunderings	1
and	1
their	1
stealings	1
Helaman	1
622	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
their	1
signs	1
yea	1
their	1
secret	1
signs	1
and	1
their	1
secret	1
words	1
and	1
this	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
distinguish	1
a	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
wickedness	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
do	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
injured	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
nor	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
his	1
band	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
this	1
covenant	1
Helaman	1
623	1
23	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
might	1
murder	1
and	1
plunder	1
and	1
steal	1
and	1
commit	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
Helaman	1
624	1
24	1
And	1
whosoever	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
their	1
band	1
should	1
reveal	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
should	1
be	1
tried	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
Gadianton	1
and	1
Kishkumen	1
Helaman	1
625	1
25	1
Now	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
these	1
secret	1
oaths	1
and	1
covenants	1
which	1
Alma	1
commanded	1
his	1
son	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
626	1
26	1
Now	1
behold	1
those	1
secret	1
oaths	1
and	1
covenants	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
Gadianton	1
from	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Helaman	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
by	1
that	1
same	1
being	1
who	1
did	1
entice	1
our	1
first	1
parents	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
forbidden	1
fruit	1
Helaman	1
627	1
27	1
Yea	1
that	1
same	1
being	1
who	1
did	1
plot	1
with	1
Cain	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
murder	1
his	1
brother	1
Abel	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
plot	1
with	1
Cain	1
and	1
his	1
followers	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
Helaman	1
628	1
28	1
And	1
also	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
same	1
being	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
tower	1
sufficiently	1
high	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
to	1
heaven	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
same	1
being	1
who	1
led	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
that	1
tower	1
into	1
this	1
land	1
who	1
spread	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
abominations	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
until	1
he	1
dragged	1
the	1
people	1
down	1
to	1
an	1
entire	1
destruction	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
everlasting	1
hell	1
Helaman	1
629	1
29	1
Yea	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
same	1
being	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
to	1
still	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
of	1
secret	1
murder	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
it	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
man	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
time	1
Helaman	1
630	1
30	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
all	1
sin	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
doth	1
carry	1
on	1
his	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
secret	1
murder	1
and	1
doth	1
hand	1
down	1
their	1
plots	1
and	1
their	1
oaths	1
and	1
their	1
covenants	1
and	1
their	1
plans	1
of	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Helaman	1
631	1
31	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
great	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
wicked	1
yea	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness	1
and	1
did	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
did	1
turn	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
ways	1
and	1
did	1
build	1
up	1
unto	1
themselves	1
idols	1
of	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
their	1
silver	1
Helaman	1
632	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
iniquities	1
did	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
not	1
many	1
years	1
insomuch	1
that	1
a	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
633	1
33	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
grow	1
in	1
their	1
iniquities	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
also	1
Helaman	1
634	1
34	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
grow	1
in	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
while	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
yea	1
they	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
commandments	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
uprightness	1
before	1
him	1
Helaman	1
635	1
35	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
began	1
to	1
withdraw	1
from	1
the	1
Nephites	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
Helaman	1
636	1
36	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
began	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
easiness	1
and	1
willingness	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
words	1
Helaman	1
637	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
hunt	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
this	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
was	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
638	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
build	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
support	1
them	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
overspread	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
had	1
seduced	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
partake	1
of	1
their	1
spoils	1
and	1
to	1
join	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
secret	1
murders	1
and	1
combinations	1
Helaman	1
639	1
39	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
obtain	1
the	1
sole	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
smite	1
and	1
rend	1
and	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
meek	1
and	1
the	1
humble	1
followers	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
640	1
40	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
awful	1
state	1
and	1
ripening	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
641	1
41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1

1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
Nephi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Helaman	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
Helaman	1
72	1
2	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
and	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
prophesy	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
reject	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stay	1
among	1
them	1
but	1
returned	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
nativity	1
Helaman	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
seeing	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
such	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
and	1
those	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
filling	1
the	1
judgmentseatshaving	1
usurped	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
aright	1
before	1
him	1
doing	1
no	1
justice	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Helaman	1
75	1
5	1
Condemning	1
the	1
righteous	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
righteousness	1
letting	1
the	1
guilty	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
go	1
unpunished	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
money	1
and	1
moreover	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
office	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1

to	1
rule	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
their	1

that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
gain	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
moreover	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
commit	1
adultery	1

kill	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
their	1

wills	1
Helaman	1

Now	1
this	1
great	1
iniquity	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
not	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
when	1
Nephi	1
saw	1
it	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
swollen	1
with	1
sorrow	1
within	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
exclaim	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
Helaman	1
77	1
7	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
Nephi	1
first	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
joyed	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
then	1
were	1
his	1
people	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
entreated	1
firm	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
slow	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
quick	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
78	1
8	1
Yea	1
if	1
my	1
days	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
then	1
would	1
my	1
soul	1
have	1
had	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
Helaman	1
79	1
9	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
consigned	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
Helaman	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
a	1
tower	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Nephi	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
highway	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
market	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
therefore	1
Nephi	1
had	1
bowed	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
tower	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
garden	1
which	1
tower	1
was	1
also	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
garden	1
gate	1
by	1
which	1
led	1
the	1
highway	1
Helaman	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
men	1
passing	1
by	1
and	1
saw	1
Nephi	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
pouring	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
tower	1
and	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
together	1
in	1
multitudes	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
712	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
Nephi	1
arose	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
Helaman	1
713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
why	1
have	1
ye	1
gathered	1
yourselves	1
together	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Helaman	1
714	1
14	1
Yea	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
upon	1
my	1
tower	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
soul	1
unto	1
my	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
sorrow	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Helaman	1
715	1
15	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
mourning	1
and	1
lamentation	1
ye	1
have	1
gathered	1
yourselves	1
together	1
and	1
do	1
marvel	1
yea	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
great	1
need	1
to	1
marvel	1
yea	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
marvel	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
given	1
away	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
got	1
so	1
great	1
hold	1
upon	1
your	1
hearts	1
Helaman	1
716	1
16	1
Yea	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
enticing	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
seeking	1
to	1
hurl	1
away	1
your	1
souls	1
down	1
to	1
everlasting	1
misery	1
and	1
endless	1
wo	1
Helaman	1
717	1
17	1
O	1
repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
Why	1
will	1
ye	1
die	1
Turn	1
ye	1
turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
Why	1
has	1
he	1
forsaken	1
you	1
Helaman	1
718	1
18	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
hardened	1
your	1
hearts	1
yea	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
yea	1
ye	1
have	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
you	1
Helaman	1
719	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
instead	1
of	1
gathering	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
behold	1
he	1
shall	1
scatter	1
you	1
forth	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
become	1
meat	1
for	1
dogs	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts	1
Helaman	1
720	1
20	1
O	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
forgotten	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
delivered	1
you	1
Helaman	1
721	1
21	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
to	1
be	1
praised	1
of	1
men	1
yea	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
get	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
set	1
your	1
hearts	1
upon	1
the	1
riches	1
and	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
murder	1
and	1
plunder	1
and	1
steal	1
and	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
your	1
neighbor	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
Helaman	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
wo	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
repent	1
behold	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
those	1
great	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
possession	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
grant	1
unto	1
you	1
strength	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
hitherto	1
done	1
to	1
withstand	1
against	1
your	1
enemies	1
Helaman	1
723	1
23	1
For	1
behold	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
my	1
strength	1
to	1
one	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
Now	1
therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
than	1
for	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
724	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
you	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
that	1
great	1
knowledge	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
yea	1
he	1
will	1
lengthen	1
out	1
their	1
days	1
and	1
increase	1
their	1
seed	1
even	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
except	1
thou	1
shalt	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
725	1
25	1
Yea	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
abomination	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
united	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
it	1
yea	1
to	1
that	1
secret	1
band	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
by	1
Gadianton	1
Helaman	1
726	1
26	1
Yea	1
wo	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
pride	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
suffered	1
to	1
enter	1
your	1
hearts	1
which	1
has	1
lifted	1
you	1
up	1
beyond	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
riches	1
Helaman	1
727	1
27	1
Yea	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
Helaman	1
728	1
28	1
And	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
shall	1
perish	1
yea	1
even	1
your	1
lands	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
729	1
29	1
Behold	1
now	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
myself	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
behold	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
has	1
made	1
them	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
testify	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1

Chapter	1

Helaman	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Nephi	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
judges	1
who	1
also	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
secret	1
band	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
saying	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
seize	1
upon	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
condemned	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
crime	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
Helaman	1
82	1
2	1
Why	1
seest	1
thou	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
hearest	1
him	1
revile	1
against	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
against	1
our	1
law	1
Helaman	1
83	1
3	1
For	1
behold	1
Nephi	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
corruptness	1
of	1
their	1
law	1
yea	1
many	1
things	1
did	1
Nephi	1
speak	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
and	1
nothing	1
did	1
he	1
speak	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
Helaman	1
84	1
4	1
And	1
those	1
judges	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
spake	1
plainly	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
secret	1
works	1
of	1
darkness	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
cry	1
out	1
against	1
them	1
Helaman	1
85	1
5	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
saying	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
suffer	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
revile	1
against	1
us	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
doth	1
condemn	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
these	1
our	1
great	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
them	1
Helaman	1
86	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
behold	1
we	1
are	1
powerful	1
and	1
our	1
cities	1
great	1
therefore	1
our	1
enemies	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
us	1
Helaman	1
87	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
Nephi	1
and	1
raised	1
contentions	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
who	1
did	1
cry	1
out	1
Let	1
this	1
man	1
alone	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
and	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saith	1
will	1
surely	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
except	1
we	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
88	1
8	1
Yea	1
behold	1
all	1
the	1
judgments	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
testified	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
testified	1
aright	1
unto	1
us	1
concerning	1
our	1
iniquities	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
many	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
as	1
well	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
befall	1
us	1
as	1
he	1
knoweth	1
of	1
our	1
iniquities	1
Helaman	1
89	1
9	1
Yea	1
and	1
behold	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
prophet	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
testified	1
concerning	1
those	1
things	1
Helaman	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
Nephi	1
were	1
compelled	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
fear	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
therefore	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
favor	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
some	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
fear	1
Helaman	1
811	1
11	1
Therefore	1
he	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
speak	1
more	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
one	1
man	1
even	1
Moses	1
to	1
smite	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Sea	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Israelites	1
who	1
were	1
our	1
fathers	1
came	1
through	1
upon	1
dry	1
ground	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
closed	1
upon	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
swallowed	1
them	1
up	1
Helaman	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
if	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
this	1
man	1
such	1
power	1
then	1
why	1
should	1
ye	1
dispute	1
among	1
yourselves	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
no	1
power	1
whereby	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
judgments	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
813	1
13	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
not	1
only	1
deny	1
my	1
words	1
but	1
ye	1
also	1
deny	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
this	1
man	1
Moses	1
who	1
had	1
such	1
great	1
power	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
yea	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Messiah	1
Helaman	1
814	1
14	1
Yea	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
brazen	1
serpent	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
who	1
should	1
come	1
Helaman	1
815	1
15	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
should	1
look	1
upon	1
that	1
serpent	1
should	1
live	1
even	1
so	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
should	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
faith	1
having	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit	1
might	1
live	1
even	1
unto	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
eternal	1
Helaman	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
Moses	1
did	1
not	1
only	1
testify	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
from	1
his	1
days	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
Helaman	1
817	1
17	1
Yea	1
and	1
behold	1
Abraham	1
saw	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
gladness	1
and	1
did	1
rejoice	1
Helaman	1
818	1
18	1
Yea	1
and	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
Abraham	1
not	1
only	1
knew	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
before	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
yea	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
and	1
this	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
shown	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
thousand	1
years	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
that	1
even	1
redemption	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
819	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
even	1
since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
many	1
prophets	1
that	1
have	1
testified	1
these	1
things	1
yea	1
behold	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
did	1
testify	1
boldly	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
slain	1
Helaman	1
820	1
20	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
Zenock	1
and	1
also	1
Ezias	1
and	1
also	1
Isaiah	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
Jeremiah	1
being	1
that	1
same	1
prophet	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
destroyed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
O	1
then	1
why	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
come	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
prophecy	1
Helaman	1
821	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
you	1
dispute	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
destroyed	1
Will	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
all	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
Mulek	1
Yea	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
behold	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
are	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
Helaman	1
822	1
22	1
Our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
was	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
because	1
he	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
Nephi	1
also	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
also	1
almost	1
all	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
time	1
yea	1
they	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
have	1
looked	1
forward	1
and	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Helaman	1
823	1
23	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
is	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
redeemed	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
unto	1
him	1
glory	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
Helaman	1
824	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
seeing	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
cannot	1
deny	1
them	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
therefore	1
in	1
this	1
ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
rejected	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
notwithstanding	1
so	1
many	1
evidences	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
yea	1
even	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
all	1
things	1
both	1
things	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
Helaman	1
825	1
25	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
rebelled	1
against	1
your	1
holy	1
God	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
instead	1
of	1
laying	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
in	1
heaven	1
where	1
nothing	1
doth	1
corrupt	1
and	1
where	1
nothing	1
can	1
come	1
which	1
is	1
unclean	1
ye	1
are	1
heaping	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
Helaman	1
826	1
26	1
Yea	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
ye	1
are	1
ripening	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
murders	1
and	1
your	1
fornication	1
and	1
wickedness	1
for	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
yea	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
soon	1
Helaman	1
827	1
27	1
Yea	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
even	1
at	1
your	1
doors	1
yea	1
go	1
ye	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
search	1
and	1
behold	1
your	1
judge	1
is	1
murdered	1
and	1
he	1
lieth	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
murdered	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
seeketh	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
Helaman	1
828	1
28	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
both	1
belong	1
to	1
your	1
secret	1
band	1
whose	1
author	1
is	1
Gadianton	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1

Helaman	1
91	1
1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Nephi	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
certain	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
among	1
them	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
yea	1
even	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
who	1
went	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
Helaman	1
92	1
2	1
Behold	1
now	1
we	1
will	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
whether	1
this	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
prophet	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
prophesy	1
such	1
marvelous	1
things	1
unto	1
us	1
Behold	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
yea	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prophet	1
nevertheless	1
if	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
concerning	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
dead	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
spoken	1
are	1
true	1
Helaman	1
93	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
ran	1
in	1
their	1
might	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
did	1
lie	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
Helaman	1
94	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
this	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
exceedingly	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
believed	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Nephi	1
had	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
Helaman	1
95	1
5	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
they	1
believed	1
and	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
lest	1
all	1
the	1
judgments	1
which	1
Nephi	1
had	1
spoken	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
quake	1
and	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
96	1

Now	1
immediately	1
when	1
the	1
judge	1
had	1
been	1
murderedhe	1
being	1
stabbed	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
by	1
a	1
garb	1
of	1
secrecy	1
and	1
he	1
fled	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
raising	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
murder	1
among	1
them	1
Helaman	1
97	1

And	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
judgmentseatand	1
behold	1
to	1
their	1
astonishment	1
they	1
saw	1
those	1
five	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
98	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
knew	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
the	1
multitude	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Nephi	1
therefore	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
murdered	1
the	1
judge	1
and	1
God	1
has	1
smitten	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
flee	1
from	1
us	1
Helaman	1
99	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
bound	1
them	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
proclamation	1
sent	1
abroad	1
that	1
the	1
judge	1
was	1
slain	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
murderers	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
and	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
Helaman	1
910	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
mourn	1
and	1
to	1
fast	1
at	1
the	1
burial	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
chief	1
judge	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
Helaman	1
911	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
also	1
those	1
judges	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
also	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
burial	1
Helaman	1
912	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
inquired	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
saying	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
five	1
who	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
inquire	1
concerning	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
Concerning	1
this	1
five	1
whom	1
ye	1
say	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
murderers	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
Helaman	1
913	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
desired	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
five	1
who	1
were	1
sent	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
judges	1
inquired	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
914	1
14	1
We	1
ran	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
all	1
things	1
even	1
as	1
Nephi	1
had	1
testified	1
we	1
were	1
astonished	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
recovered	1
from	1
our	1
astonishment	1
behold	1
they	1
cast	1
us	1
into	1
prison	1
Helaman	1
915	1
15	1
Now	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
who	1
has	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
only	1
this	1
much	1
we	1
know	1
we	1
ran	1
and	1
came	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
desired	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
916	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
did	1
expound	1
the	1
matter	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
did	1
cry	1
out	1
against	1
Nephi	1
saying	1
Behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
Nephi	1
must	1
have	1
agreed	1
with	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
judge	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
might	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
convert	1
us	1
unto	1
his	1
faith	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
raise	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
chosen	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
prophet	1
Helaman	1
917	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
will	1
detect	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
confess	1
his	1
fault	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
true	1
murderer	1
of	1
this	1
judge	1
Helaman	1
918	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
five	1
were	1
liberated	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
burial	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
rebuke	1
the	1
judges	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
against	1
Nephi	1
and	1
did	1
contend	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
confound	1
them	1
Helaman	1
919	1
19	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
caused	1
that	1
Nephi	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
in	1
divers	1
ways	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cross	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him	1
to	1
death	1
Helaman	1
920	1
20	1
Saying	1
unto	1
him	1
Thou	1
art	1
confederate	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
murder	1
Now	1
tell	1
us	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
thy	1
fault	1
saying	1
Behold	1
here	1
is	1
money	1
and	1
also	1
we	1
will	1
grant	1
unto	1
thee	1
thy	1
life	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
tell	1
us	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
agreement	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
with	1
him	1
Helaman	1
921	1
21	1
But	1
Nephi	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
O	1
ye	1
fools	1
ye	1
uncircumcised	1
of	1
heart	1
ye	1
blind	1
and	1
ye	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
do	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
will	1
suffer	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
sin	1
Helaman	1
922	1
22	1
O	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
howl	1
and	1
mourn	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
destruction	1
which	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
doth	1
await	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
923	1
23	1
Behold	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
agreed	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
murder	1
Seezoram	1
our	1
chief	1
judge	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
testified	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
yea	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you	1
Helaman	1
924	1
24	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
agreed	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
yea	1
because	1
I	1
showed	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
sign	1
ye	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
life	1
Helaman	1
925	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
another	1
sign	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
Helaman	1
926	1
26	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Seantum	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Seezoram	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
Helaman	1
927	1
27	1
Has	1
Nephi	1
the	1
pretended	1
prophet	1
who	1
doth	1
prophesy	1
so	1
much	1
evil	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
agreed	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
murdered	1
Seezoram	1
who	1
is	1
your	1
brother	1
Helaman	1
928	1
28	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
Helaman	1
929	1
29	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
Have	1
ye	1
murdered	1
your	1
brother	1
Helaman	1
930	1
30	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
shall	1
deny	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
astonished	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
shall	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent	1
Helaman	1
931	1
31	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
examine	1
him	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
his	1
cloak	1
Helaman	1
932	1
32	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
From	1
whence	1
cometh	1
this	1
blood	1
Do	1
we	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
brother	1
Helaman	1
933	1
33	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
tremble	1
and	1
shall	1
look	1
pale	1
even	1
as	1
if	1
death	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
Helaman	1
934	1
34	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
Because	1
of	1
this	1
fear	1
and	1
this	1
paleness	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
upon	1
your	1
face	1
behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
guilty	1
Helaman	1
935	1
35	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
greater	1
fear	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
confess	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
deny	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
this	1
murder	1
Helaman	1
936	1
36	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
Nephi	1
know	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
God	1
Helaman	1
937	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
did	1
even	1
according	1
as	1
Nephi	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
were	1
true	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
did	1
deny	1
and	1
also	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
did	1
confess	1
Helaman	1
938	1
38	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
murderer	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
five	1
were	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
and	1
also	1
was	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
939	1
39	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
also	1
who	1
believed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
converted	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
prison	1
Helaman	1
940	1
40	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
Nephi	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
Helaman	1
941	1
41	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
others	1
who	1
said	1
Behold	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
god	1
for	1
except	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
has	1
told	1
us	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
our	1
hearts	1
and	1
also	1
has	1
told	1
us	1
things	1
and	1
even	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
unto	1
our	1
knowledge	1
the	1
true	1
murderer	1
of	1
our	1
chief	1

101	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
divided	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
and	1
went	1
their	1

leaving	1
Nephi	1
alone	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
them	1
Helaman	1
102	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
towards	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
pondering	1
upon	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shown	1
unto	1
him	1

103	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
ponderingbeing	1
much	1
cast	1
down	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
their	1
secret	1
works	1

their	1

and	1
their	1
plunderings	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquitiesand	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
pondering	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
behold	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
104	1

Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
Nephi	1
for	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
beheld	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
with	1
unwearyingness	1
declared	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
feared	1
them	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
sought	1
thine	1
own	1
life	1
but	1
hast	1
sought	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
Helaman	1
105	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
with	1
such	1
unwearyingness	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee	1
forever	1
and	1
I	1
will	1

thee	1
mighty	1
in	1
word	1

in	1

yea	1
even	1
that	1
all	1

shall	1
be	1

unto	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1

thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
ask	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
my	1
will	1
Helaman	1
106	1
6	1
Behold	1
thou	1
art	1
Nephi	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
God	1
Behold	1
I	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
mine	1
angels	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1

with	1

and	1
destruction	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Helaman	1
107	1

Behold	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
power	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
seal	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
sealed	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
power	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
Helaman	1
108	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
temple	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1

And	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain	1
Be	1
thou	1
cast	1
down	1
and	1
become	1
smooth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1

1010	1
10	1
And	1
behold	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
that	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
this	1
people	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
Helaman	1
1011	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
declare	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Almighty	1
Except	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
1012	1
12	1
And	1
behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
he	1
did	1
stop	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
but	1
did	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
multitudes	1
who	1
were	1
scattered	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him	1
concerning	1
their	1
destruction	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
1013	1
13	1
Now	1
behold	1
notwithstanding	1
that	1
great	1
miracle	1
which	1
Nephi	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
telling	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
they	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1014	1
14	1
Therefore	1
Nephi	1
did	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
Except	1
ye	1
repent	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
even	1
unto	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
1015	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Nephi	1
had	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
word	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
still	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
words	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
revile	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
seek	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison	1
Helaman	1
1016	1
16	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
conveyed	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1017	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
he	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
from	1
multitude	1
to	1
multitude	1
declaring	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
even	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
or	1
sent	1
it	1
forth	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
1018	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
contentions	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
divided	1
against	1
themselves	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
slay	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
Helaman	1
1019	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
11	1
Chapter	1
11	1
Helaman	1
111	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
the	1
contentions	1
did	1
increase	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
wars	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
112	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
secret	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
who	1
did	1
carry	1
on	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
wickedness	1
And	1
this	1
war	1
did	1
last	1
all	1
that	1
year	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
it	1
did	1
also	1
last	1
Helaman	1
113	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
Nephi	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
114	1
4	1
O	1
Lord	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
but	1
O	1
Lord	1
rather	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
thee	1
Helaman	1
115	1
5	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
famine	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
the	1
famine	1
did	1
continue	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
did	1
cease	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
but	1
became	1
sore	1
by	1
famine	1
Helaman	1
116	1
6	1
And	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
did	1
also	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
smitten	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
yield	1
forth	1
grain	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
was	1
smitten	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
perish	1
by	1
thousands	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
117	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
118	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
plead	1
with	1
their	1
chief	1
judges	1
and	1
their	1
leaders	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
say	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
Behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
therefore	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
this	1
famine	1
lest	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
our	1
destruction	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Helaman	1
119	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
did	1
say	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
desired	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Nephi	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
repented	1
and	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
he	1
cried	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
1110	1
10	1
O	1
Lord	1
behold	1
this	1
people	1
repenteth	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
swept	1
away	1

them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1

their	1

1111	1
11	1
Now	1
O	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
their	1
humility	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
thine	1
anger	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
anger	1
be	1
appeased	1
in	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
those	1
wicked	1
men	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
already	1
destroyed	1
Helaman	1
1112	1
12	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
thine	1
anger	1
yea	1
thy	1
fierce	1
anger	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
this	1
famine	1
may	1
cease	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
Helaman	1
1113	1
13	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
send	1
forth	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit	1
and	1
her	1
grain	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
grain	1
Helaman	1
1114	1
14	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
didst	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
when	1
I	1
said	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
famine	1
that	1
the	1
pestilence	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
might	1
cease	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
thou	1
saidst	1
that	1
If	1
this	1
people	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1115	1
15	1
Yea	1
O	1
Lord	1
and	1
thou	1
seest	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
repented	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
famine	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence	1
and	1
destruction	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1116	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
thine	1
anger	1
and	1
try	1
again	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
serve	1
thee	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
canst	1
bless	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
Helaman	1
1117	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
turn	1
away	1
his	1
anger	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
caused	1
that	1
rain	1
should	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
insomuch	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
bring	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
her	1
fruit	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
bring	1
forth	1
her	1
grain	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
her	1
grain	1
Helaman	1
1118	1
18	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
rejoice	1
and	1
glorify	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
Nephi	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
having	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
God	1
Helaman	1
1119	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
Lehi	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
Helaman	1
1120	1
20	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
their	1
waste	1
places	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
multiply	1
and	1
spread	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
did	1
cover	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
northward	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
southward	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
east	1
Helaman	1
1121	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
did	1
end	1
in	1
peace	1
And	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
began	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
did	1
spread	1
throughout	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
both	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
Helaman	1
1122	1
22	1
And	1
also	1
they	1
had	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
contentions	1
concerning	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
Helaman	1
1123	1
23	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
strife	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
knew	1
concerning	1
the	1
true	1
points	1
of	1
doctrine	1
having	1
many	1
revelations	1
daily	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
their	1
strife	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
Helaman	1
1124	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
eightieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
dissenters	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
who	1
had	1
some	1
years	1
before	1
gone	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
taken	1
upon	1
themselves	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
who	1
were	1
real	1
descendants	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
being	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
by	1
them	1
or	1
by	1
those	1
dissenters	1
therefore	1
they	1
commenced	1
a	1
war	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
Helaman	1
1125	1
25	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
commit	1
murder	1
and	1
plunder	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
would	1
retreat	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
secret	1
places	1
hiding	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
discovered	1
receiving	1
daily	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
their	1
numbers	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
dissenters	1
that	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1126	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
time	1
yea	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
not	1
many	1
years	1
they	1
became	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
search	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
secret	1
plans	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
became	1
robbers	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
Helaman	1
1127	1
27	1
Now	1
behold	1
these	1
robbers	1
did	1
make	1
great	1
havoc	1
yea	1
even	1
great	1
destruction	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Helaman	1
1128	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
stop	1
put	1
to	1
this	1
work	1
of	1
destruction	1
therefore	1
they	1
sent	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
strong	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
this	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1129	1
29	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
even	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eightieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
1130	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
again	1
against	1
this	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
did	1
destroy	1
many	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
visited	1
with	1
much	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
1131	1
31	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
obliged	1
to	1
return	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
exceeding	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
those	1
robbers	1
who	1
infested	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
the	1
wilderness	1
Helaman	1
1132	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
ended	1
this	1
year	1
And	1
the	1
robbers	1
did	1
still	1
increase	1
and	1
wax	1
strong	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
defy	1
the	1
whole	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
great	1
fear	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
1133	1
33	1
Yea	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
visit	1
many	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
did	1
do	1
great	1
destruction	1
unto	1
them	1
yea	1
did	1
kill	1
many	1
and	1
did	1
carry	1
away	1
others	1
captive	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Helaman	1
1134	1
34	1
Now	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
did	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Helaman	1
1135	1
35	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
1136	1
36	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
they	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
iniquity	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
mend	1
their	1
ways	1
Helaman	1
1137	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
wax	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
in	1
their	1
pride	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
ripening	1
again	1
for	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
1138	1
38	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
Helaman	1
12	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Helaman	1
121	1
1	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
can	1
behold	1
how	1
false	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
unsteadiness	1
of	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
yea	1
we	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
infinite	1
goodness	1
doth	1
bless	1
and	1
prosper	1
those	1
who	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
Helaman	1
122	1
2	1
Yea	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
doth	1
prosper	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
their	1
fields	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
in	1
silver	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
art	1
sparing	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
delivering	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
softening	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
declare	1
wars	1
against	1
them	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
doing	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
happiness	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
do	1
forget	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
do	1
trample	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
the	1
Holy	1
Oneyea	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
ease	1
and	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
prosperity	1
Helaman	1
123	1
3	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
except	1
the	1
Lord	1
doth	1
chasten	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
many	1
afflictions	1
yea	1
except	1
he	1
doth	1
visit	1
them	1
with	1
death	1
and	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
with	1
famine	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
pestilence	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
remember	1
him	1
Helaman	1
124	1
4	1
O	1
how	1
foolish	1
and	1
how	1
vain	1
and	1
how	1
evil	1
and	1
devilish	1
and	1
how	1
quick	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
and	1
how	1
slow	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
yea	1
how	1
quick	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
one	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
their	1
hearts	1
upon	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Helaman	1
125	1
5	1
Yea	1
how	1
quick	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
pride	1
yea	1
how	1
quick	1
to	1
boast	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
iniquity	1
and	1
how	1
slow	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
his	1
counsels	1
yea	1
how	1
slow	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
wisdoms	1
paths	1
Helaman	1
126	1
6	1
Behold	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
who	1
hath	1
created	1

O	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
nothingness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
yea	1
even	1
they	1
are	1
less	1

128	1

For	1
behold	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
moveth	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

of	1
our	1

God	1
Helaman	1
129	1

Yea	1
behold	1
at	1
his	1
voice	1
do	1
the	1
hills	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
tremble	1
and	1
quake	1
Helaman	1
1210	1
10	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
they	1
are	1
broken	1
up	1
and	1
become	1
smooth	1
yea	1
even	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
valley	1
Helaman	1
1211	1
11	1
Yea	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
doth	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
shake	1
Helaman	1
1212	1
12	1
Yea	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
do	1
the	1
foundations	1
rock	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
very	1

And	1
thus	1
according	1
to	1
his	1

the	1
earth	1
goeth	1
back	1
and	1
it	1
appeareth	1
unto	1

this	1

And	1
behold	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
a	1

will	1

Helaman	1
1222	1
22	1
And	1
wo	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
this	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
iniquity	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
therefore	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
that	1
men	1
might	1
be	1
saved	1
hath	1
repentance	1
been	1
declared	1
Helaman	1
1223	1
23	1
Therefore	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
Helaman	1
1224	1
24	1
And	1
may	1
God	1
grant	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
fulness	1
that	1
men	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
good	1
works	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
grace	1
for	1
grace	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
Helaman	1
1225	1
25	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
might	1
be	1
saved	1
But	1
we	1
read	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
last	1
day	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
yea	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1226	1
26	1
Yea	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
consigned	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
endless	1
misery	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
say	1
They	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
good	1
shall	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
shall	1
have	1
everlasting	1
damnation	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
Amen	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
still	1
remain	1
in	1
wickedness	1
yea	1
in	1
great	1
wickedness	1
while	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
observe	1
strictly	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Helaman	1
132	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Samuel	1
a	1
Lamanite	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
preach	1
many	1
days	1
repentance	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land	1
Helaman	1
133	1
3	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
again	1
and	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
Helaman	1
134	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
therefore	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
got	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof	1
and	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
and	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
Helaman	1
135	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
I	1
Samuel	1
a	1
Lamanite	1
do	1
speak	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
he	1
doth	1
put	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
justice	1
hangeth	1
over	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
years	1
pass	1
not	1
away	1
save	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
justice	1
falleth	1
upon	1
this	1
people	1
Helaman	1
136	1
6	1
Yea	1
heavy	1
destruction	1
awaiteth	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
it	1
surely	1
cometh	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
save	1
this	1
people	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
repentance	1
and	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
surely	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
shall	1
suffer	1
many	1
things	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
Helaman	1
137	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
declared	1
it	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
bring	1
glad	1
tidings	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
glad	1
tidings	1
but	1
behold	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
receive	1
me	1
Helaman	1
138	1
8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
word	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
withdraw	1
my	1
Spirit	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
suffer	1
them	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
against	1
them	1
Helaman	1
139	1
9	1
And	1
four	1
hundred	1
years	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
before	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
yea	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
with	1
famine	1
and	1
with	1
pestilence	1
Helaman	1
1310	1
10	1
Yea	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
who	1
shall	1
live	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
to	1
behold	1
your	1
utter	1
destruction	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
surely	1
come	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
shall	1
visit	1
your	1
destruction	1
Helaman	1
1311	1
11	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
away	1
mine	1
anger	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
me	1
but	1
wo	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
repenteth	1
not	1
Helaman	1
1312	1
12	1
Yea	1
wo	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
righteous	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
saved	1
yea	1
wo	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
yea	1
even	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
that	1
will	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1313	1
13	1
But	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
will	1
repent	1
for	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
spare	1
But	1
behold	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
behold	1
I	1
would	1
cause	1
that	1
fire	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
destroy	1
it	1
Helaman	1
1314	1
14	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
righteous	1
sake	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
spared	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
ripe	1
for	1
destruction	1
yea	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
her	1
Helaman	1
1315	1
15	1
Yea	1
and	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Gideon	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
her	1
Helaman	1
1316	1
16	1
Yea	1
and	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
round	1
about	1
which	1

Helaman	1
1317	1

And	1
behold	1
a	1
curse	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
peoples	1
sake	1
who	1

And	1
it	1
shall	1

saith	1

Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
yea	1
our	1
great	1

true	1
God	1
that	1
whoso	1

hide	1
up	1

shall	1

For	1
I	1

And	1
the	1

that	1

enemies	1
because	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
cursed	1
be	1
they	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
treasures	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
smitten	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1321	1
21	1
Behold	1
ye	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
yea	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
saith	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
saith	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
cursed	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
riches	1
and	1
also	1
are	1
your	1
riches	1
cursed	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
set	1
your	1
hearts	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
you	1
Helaman	1
1322	1
22	1
Ye	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
you	1
but	1
ye	1
do	1
always	1
remember	1
your	1
riches	1
not	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
for	1
them	1
yea	1
your	1
hearts	1
are	1
not	1
drawn	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
but	1
they	1
do	1
swell	1
with	1
great	1
pride	1
unto	1
boasting	1
and	1
unto	1
great	1
swelling	1
envyings	1
strifes	1
malice	1
persecutions	1
and	1
murders	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquities	1
Helaman	1
1323	1
23	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
caused	1
that	1
a	1
curse	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
also	1
upon	1
your	1
riches	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
Helaman	1
1324	1
24	1
Yea	1
wo	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
which	1
has	1
arrived	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
do	1
mock	1
them	1
and	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
do	1
slay	1
them	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
Helaman	1
1325	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
ye	1
talk	1
ye	1
say	1
If	1
our	1
days	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
of	1
old	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
slain	1
the	1
prophets	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
stoned	1
them	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
Helaman	1
1326	1
26	1
Behold	1
ye	1
are	1
worse	1
than	1
they	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
if	1
a	1
prophet	1
come	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
declareth	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
testifieth	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
ye	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
seek	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
ways	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
yea	1
you	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
false	1
prophet	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
sinner	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
because	1
he	1
testifieth	1
that	1
your	1
deeds	1
are	1
evil	1
Helaman	1
1327	1
27	1
But	1
behold	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
Do	1
this	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
iniquity	1
do	1
that	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
yea	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
Walk	1
after	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
hearts	1
yea	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
eyes	1
and	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
your	1
heart	1
desirethand	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
say	1
this	1
ye	1
will	1
receive	1
him	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prophet	1
Helaman	1
1328	1
28	1
Yea	1
ye	1
will	1
lift	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
your	1
substance	1
ye	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
your	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
silver	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
clothe	1
him	1
with	1
costly	1
apparel	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
speaketh	1
flattering	1
words	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
well	1
then	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
him	1
Helaman	1
1329	1
29	1
O	1
ye	1
wicked	1
and	1
ye	1
perverse	1
generation	1
ye	1
hardened	1
and	1
ye	1
stiffnecked	1
people	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
suffer	1
you	1
Yea	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
by	1
foolish	1
and	1
blind	1
guides	1
Yea	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
ye	1
choose	1
darkness	1
rather	1
than	1
light	1
Helaman	1
1330	1
30	1
Yea	1
behold	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
already	1
kindled	1
against	1
you	1
behold	1
he	1
hath	1
cursed	1
the	1
land	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquity	1
Helaman	1
1331	1
31	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
that	1
he	1
curseth	1
your	1
riches	1
that	1
they	1
become	1
slippery	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hold	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
poverty	1
ye	1
cannot	1
retain	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1332	1
32	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
poverty	1
ye	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
in	1
vain	1
shall	1
ye	1
cry	1
for	1
your	1
desolation	1
is	1
already	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
destruction	1
is	1
made	1
sure	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
weep	1
and	1
howl	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
lament	1
and	1
say	1
Helaman	1
1333	1
33	1
O	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
repented	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
killed	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
stoned	1
them	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
Yea	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
O	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
remembered	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
our	1
riches	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
become	1
slippery	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
lose	1
them	1
for	1
behold	1
our	1
riches	1
are	1
gone	1
from	1
us	1
Helaman	1
1334	1
34	1
Behold	1
we	1
lay	1
a	1
tool	1
here	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
it	1
is	1
gone	1
and	1
behold	1
our	1
swords	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
have	1
sought	1
them	1
for	1
battle	1
Helaman	1
1335	1
35	1
Yea	1
we	1
have	1
hid	1
up	1
our	1
treasures	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
slipped	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
1336	1
36	1
O	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
repented	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
cursed	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
become	1
slippery	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
hold	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1337	1
37	1
Behold	1
we	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
demons	1
yea	1
we	1
are	1
encircled	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
our	1
souls	1
Behold	1
our	1
iniquities	1
are	1
great	1
O	1
Lord	1
canst	1
thou	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
thine	1
anger	1
from	1
us	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
language	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
Helaman	1
1338	1
38	1
But	1
behold	1
your	1
days	1
of	1
probation	1
are	1
past	1
ye	1
have	1
procrastinated	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
salvation	1
until	1
it	1
is	1
everlastingly	1
too	1
late	1
and	1
your	1
destruction	1
is	1
made	1
sure	1
yea	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
sought	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
obtain	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
sought	1
for	1
happiness	1
in	1
doing	1
iniquity	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
that	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
our	1
great	1
and	1
Eternal	1
Head	1
Helaman	1
1339	1
39	1
O	1
ye	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
hear	1
my	1
words	1
And	1
I	1
pray	1
that	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
repent	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1

Chapter	1
14	1
Helaman	1
141	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
did	1
prophesy	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
Helaman	1
142	1
2	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
sign	1
for	1
five	1
years	1
more	1
cometh	1
and	1
behold	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
redeem	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Helaman	1
143	1
3	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
for	1
behold	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
lights	1
in	1
heaven	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
he	1
cometh	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
darkness	1
insomuch	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
appear	1
unto	1
man	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
day	1
Helaman	1
144	1
4	1
Therefore	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
a	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
day	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
night	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
its	1
setting	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
a	1
night	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
night	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
darkened	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
he	1
is	1
born	1
Helaman	1
145	1
5	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
shall	1
a	1
new	1
star	1
arise	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
ye	1
never	1
have	1
beheld	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
you	1
Helaman	1
146	1
6	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
Helaman	1
147	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
amazed	1
and	1
wonder	1
insomuch	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Helaman	1
148	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life	1
Helaman	1
149	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
angel	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prophesy	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
Cry	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
repent	1
and	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1410	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Lamanite	1
and	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
against	1
you	1
ye	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
do	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
and	1
have	1
cast	1
me	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
Helaman	1
1411	1
11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
words	1
for	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
have	1
I	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
hear	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
do	1
await	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
iniquities	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
repentance	1
Helaman	1
1412	1
12	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
of	1
earth	1
the	1
Creator	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
Helaman	1
1413	1
13	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name	1
ye	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
sins	1
that	1
thereby	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
them	1
through	1
his	1
merits	1
Helaman	1
1414	1
14	1
And	1
behold	1
again	1
another	1
sign	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
Helaman	1
1415	1
15	1
For	1
behold	1
he	1
surely	1
must	1
die	1
that	1
salvation	1
may	1
come	1
yea	1
it	1
behooveth	1
him	1
and	1
becometh	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
dieth	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1

1416	1

Yea	1
behold	1
this	1
death	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1

redeemeth	1
all	1
mankind	1
from	1
the	1

for	1

1417	1

But	1
behold	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
redeemeth	1
mankind	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
mankind	1
and	1
bringeth	1
them	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1418	1
18	1
Yea	1
and	1
it	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
repentance	1
that	1
whosoever	1
repenteth	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
not	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
but	1
whosoever	1
repenteth	1
not	1
is	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
there	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them	1
again	1
a	1
spiritual	1
death	1
yea	1
a	1
second	1
death	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
again	1
as	1
to	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
righteousness	1
Helaman	1
1419	1
19	1
Therefore	1
repent	1
ye	1
repent	1
ye	1
lest	1
by	1
knowing	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
not	1
doing	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
come	1
under	1
condemnation	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
brought	1
down	1
unto	1
this	1
second	1
death	1
Helaman	1
1420	1

But	1
behold	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
another	1
sign	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
behold	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
death	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened	1
and	1
refuse	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
light	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1

there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1

upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
death	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
Helaman	1
1421	1
21	1
Yea	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
yield	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
thunderings	1
and	1
lightnings	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
hours	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
shake	1
and	1
tremble	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
earth	1
which	1
are	1
both	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
beneath	1
which	1
ye	1
know	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
are	1
solid	1
or	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
solid	1
mass	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
Helaman	1
1422	1
22	1
Yea	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
and	1
shall	1
ever	1
after	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
seams	1
and	1
in	1
cracks	1
and	1
in	1
broken	1
fragments	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
yea	1
both	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
beneath	1
Helaman	1
1423	1
23	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
tempests	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
mountains	1
laid	1
low	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
valley	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
places	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
called	1
valleys	1
which	1
shall	1
become	1
mountains	1
whose	1
height	1
is	1
great	1
Helaman	1
1424	1
24	1
And	1
many	1
highways	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
and	1
many	1
cities	1
shall	1
become	1
desolate	1
Helaman	1
1425	1
25	1
And	1
many	1
graves	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
and	1
shall	1
yield	1
up	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
and	1
many	1
saints	1
shall	1
appear	1
unto	1
many	1
Helaman	1
1426	1
26	1
And	1
behold	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
angel	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
thunderings	1
and	1
lightnings	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
hours	1
Helaman	1
1427	1
27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
lightning	1
lasted	1
and	1
the	1
tempest	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
that	1
darkness	1
should	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
Helaman	1
1428	1
28	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
many	1
shall	1
see	1
greater	1
things	1
than	1
these	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
believe	1
that	1
these	1
signs	1
and	1
these	1
wonders	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
unbelief	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Helaman	1
1429	1
29	1
And	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
whosoever	1
will	1
believe	1
might	1
be	1
saved	1
and	1
that	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
might	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
condemned	1
they	1
bring	1
upon	1
themselves	1
their	1
own	1
condemnation	1
Helaman	1
1430	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
remember	1
remember	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
whosoever	1
perisheth	1
perisheth	1
unto	1
himself	1
and	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
iniquity	1
doeth	1
it	1
unto	1
himself	1
for	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
free	1
ye	1
are	1
permitted	1
to	1
act	1
for	1
yourselves	1
for	1
behold	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
knowledge	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
free	1
Helaman	1
1431	1
31	1
He	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
choose	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
and	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
be	1
restored	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
or	1
have	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1

unto	1
you	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
behold	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
your	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate	1
Helaman	1
152	1
2	1
Yea	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
your	1
women	1
shall	1
have	1
great	1
cause	1
to	1
mourn	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
suck	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
attempt	1
to	1
flee	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1

for	1
refuge	1
yea	1
and	1
wo	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
child	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
heavy	1
and	1
cannot	1
flee	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
perish	1
Helaman	1
153	1

Yea	1
wo	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
except	1
they	1
shall	1
repent	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
showed	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
chosen	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
hath	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
also	1
hath	1
he	1
chastened	1
them	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
hath	1
he	1
chastened	1
them	1
because	1
he	1
loveth	1
them	1
Helaman	1
154	1
4	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
hath	1
he	1
hated	1
because	1
their	1
deeds	1
have	1
been	1
evil	1
continually	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
But	1
behold	1
salvation	1
hath	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
prolonged	1
their	1
days	1
Helaman	1
155	1
5	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
behold	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
walk	1
circumspectly	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
observe	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
and	1
his	1
judgments	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Helaman	1
156	1
6	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
doing	1
this	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
striving	1
with	1
unwearied	1
diligence	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bring	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
therefore	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
do	1
add	1
to	1
their	1
numbers	1
daily	1
Helaman	1
157	1
7	1
And	1
behold	1
ye	1
do	1
know	1
of	1
yourselves	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
witnessed	1
it	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
abominable	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
are	1
led	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures	1
yea	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
which	1
leadeth	1
them	1
to	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
unto	1
repentance	1
which	1
faith	1
and	1
repentance	1
bringeth	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
heart	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
158	1
8	1
Therefore	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
ye	1
know	1
of	1
yourselves	1
are	1
firm	1
and	1
steadfast	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
free	1
Helaman	1
159	1
9	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
buried	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
they	1
fear	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
up	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
should	1
sin	1
yea	1
ye	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
fear	1
to	1
sinfor	1
behold	1
they	1
will	1
suffer	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
and	1
slain	1
by	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
lift	1
their	1
swords	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Helaman	1
1510	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
steadfastness	1
when	1
they	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
they	1
do	1
believe	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
firmness	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
once	1
enlightened	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
bless	1
them	1
and	1
prolong	1
their	1
days	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
iniquity	1
Helaman	1
1511	1
11	1
Yea	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
prolong	1
their	1
days	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
prophets	1
concerning	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
Helaman	1
1512	1
12	1
Yea	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
times	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
have	1
been	1
extended	1
to	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
many	1
afflictions	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
be	1
hunted	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
smitten	1
and	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
having	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
refuge	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
Helaman	1
1513	1
13	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecy	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
again	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
knowledge	1
which	1
is	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
and	1
true	1
shepherd	1
and	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
his	1
sheep	1
Helaman	1
1514	1
14	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
than	1
for	1
you	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
Helaman	1
1515	1
15	1
For	1
behold	1
had	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
been	1
shown	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
shown	1
unto	1
you	1
yea	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
ye	1
can	1
see	1
of	1
yourselves	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
Helaman	1
1516	1
16	1
Therefore	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
wisdom	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
again	1
unto	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
1517	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
concerning	1
the	1
people	1
of	1

If	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
repent	1
and	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
my	1
will	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
many	1
mighty	1
works	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
the	1

liveth	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
saith	1

Helaman	1
161	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
upon	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
believed	1
on	1
his	1
word	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
Nephi	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
they	1
confessed	1
unto	1
him	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
denied	1
not	1
desiring	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
baptized	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Helaman	1
162	1
2	1
But	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
shot	1
arrows	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hit	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
stones	1
neither	1
with	1
their	1
arrows	1
Helaman	1
163	1
3	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hit	1
him	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
more	1
who	1
did	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
away	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
Helaman	1
164	1
4	1
For	1
behold	1
Nephi	1
was	1
baptizing	1
and	1
prophesying	1
and	1
preaching	1
crying	1
repentance	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
showing	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
working	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Christ	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
Helaman	1
165	1
5	1
Telling	1
them	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
and	1
remember	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
coming	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
beforehand	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
believe	1
therefore	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
for	1
they	1
came	1
repenting	1
and	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins	1
Helaman	1
166	1
6	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel	1
therefore	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hit	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
stones	1
and	1
their	1
arrows	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
their	1
captains	1
saying	1
Take	1
this	1
fellow	1
and	1
bind	1
him	1
for	1
behold	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
devil	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
cannot	1
hit	1
him	1
with	1
our	1
stones	1
and	1
our	1
arrows	1
therefore	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
bind	1
him	1
and	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
Helaman	1
167	1
7	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
cast	1
himself	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
did	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
yea	1
even	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
country	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
and	1
to	1
prophesy	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
Helaman	1
168	1
8	1
And	1
behold	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
more	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Helaman	1
169	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Helaman	1
1610	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
also	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
remaining	1
in	1
their	1
pride	1
and	1
wickedness	1
and	1
the	1
lesser	1
part	1
walking	1
more	1
circumspectly	1
before	1
God	1
Helaman	1
1611	1
11	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
conditions	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
1612	1
12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
little	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
hardened	1
in	1
iniquity	1
and	1
do	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
eighty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
Helaman	1
1613	1
13	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
ninetieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
signs	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Helaman	1
1614	1
14	1
And	1
angels	1
did	1
appear	1
unto	1
men	1
wise	1
men	1
and	1
did	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy	1
thus	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
the	1
scriptures	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Helaman	1
1615	1
15	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
believing	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
wisdom	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
1616	1
16	1
Some	1
things	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
guessed	1
right	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
but	1
behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
works	1
cannot	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
of	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
Helaman	1
1617	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
reason	1
and	1
to	1
contend	1
among	1
themselves	1
saying	1
Helaman	1
1618	1
18	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
reasonable	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
being	1
as	1
a	1
Christ	1
shall	1
come	1
if	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
of	1
earth	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
spoken	1
why	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
show	1
himself	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Helaman	1
1619	1
19	1
Yea	1
why	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
show	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
Helaman	1
1620	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
wicked	1
tradition	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
to	1
cause	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
believe	1
in	1
some	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
thing	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
but	1
not	1
among	1
us	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
distant	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
therefore	1
they	1
can	1
keep	1
us	1
in	1
ignorance	1
for	1
we	1
cannot	1
witness	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
eyes	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
Helaman	1
1621	1
21	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
by	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
the	1
mysterious	1
arts	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
one	1
work	1
some	1
great	1
mystery	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
understand	1
which	1
will	1
keep	1
us	1
down	1
to	1
be	1
servants	1
to	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
also	1
servants	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
we	1
depend	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
teach	1
us	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
thus	1
will	1
they	1
keep	1
us	1
in	1
ignorance	1
if	1
we	1
will	1
yield	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
Helaman	1
1622	1
22	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
things	1
did	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
which	1
were	1
foolish	1
and	1
vain	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
disturbed	1
for	1
Satan	1
did	1
stir	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
do	1
iniquity	1
continually	1
yea	1
he	1
did	1
go	1
about	1
spreading	1
rumors	1
and	1
contentions	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
harden	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
against	1
that	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
Helaman	1
1623	1
23	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
the	1
wonders	1
which	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
miracles	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
Satan	1
did	1
get	1
great	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Helaman	1
1624	1
24	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
ninetieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1

And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1

Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Lehi	1
left	1

it	1

concerning	1

the	1

Then	1
he	1

whither	1
he	1
went	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Nephi	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
records	1
in	1

stead	1
yea	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
behold	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
more	1
fully	1
for	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
greater	1
signs	1
and	1
greater	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
15	1
5	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
past	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
3	1
Nephi	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
over	1
their	1
brethren	1
saying	1
Behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel	1
are	1
not	1
fulfilled	1
therefore	1
your	1
joy	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
hath	1
been	1
vain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
uproar	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
believed	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
sorrowful	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
might	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
3	1
Nephi	1
18	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
watch	1
steadfastly	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
that	1
day	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
day	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
night	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
their	1
faith	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
vain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
set	1
apart	1
by	1
the	1
unbelievers	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
those	1
traditions	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
except	1
the	1
sign	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet	1
3	1
Nephi	1
110	1
10	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Nephi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nephi	1
saw	1
this	1
wickedness	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
3	1
Nephi	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
cried	1
mightily	1
to	1
his	1
God	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
yea	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
3	1
Nephi	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
mightily	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
saying	1
3	1
Nephi	1
113	1
13	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
head	1
and	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
night	1
shall	1
the	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
come	1
I	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
fulfill	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
my	1
holy	1
prophets	1
3	1
Nephi	1
114	1
14	1
Behold	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
fulfill	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sonof	1
the	1
Father	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
this	1
night	1
shall	1
the	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
3	1
Nephi	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
were	1
fulfilled	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
for	1
behold	1
at	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
darkness	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
3	1
Nephi	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
believed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
who	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
dead	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
plan	1
of	1
destruction	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
had	1
been	1
frustrated	1
for	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
hand	1
3	1
Nephi	1
117	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
must	1
shortly	1
appear	1
yea	1
in	1
fine	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
north	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
south	1
were	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
astonished	1
that	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
118	1
18	1
For	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
had	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
their	1
unbelief	1
3	1
Nephi	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
darkness	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
light	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
midday	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
again	1
according	1
to	1
its	1
proper	1
order	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
be	1
born	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
3	1
Nephi	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
yea	1
all	1
things	1
every	1
whit	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
3	1
Nephi	1
121	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
star	1
did	1
appear	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
3	1
Nephi	1
122	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
lyings	1
sent	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
Satan	1
to	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
those	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
but	1
notwithstanding	1
these	1
lyings	1
and	1
deceivings	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
believe	1
and	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
3	1
Nephi	1
123	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
others	1
baptizing	1
unto	1
repentance	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
have	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
124	1
24	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
contentions	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
that	1
began	1
to	1
preach	1
endeavoring	1
to	1
prove	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
expedient	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
they	1
did	1
err	1
having	1
not	1
understood	1
the	1
scriptures	1
3	1
Nephi	1
125	1
25	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
soon	1
became	1
converted	1
and	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
every	1
whit	1
yea	1
the	1
word	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
yea	1
that	1
one	1
jot	1
or	1
tittle	1
should	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
till	1
it	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
therefore	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
year	1
were	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
error	1
and	1
did	1
confess	1
their	1
faults	1
3	1
Nephi	1
126	1
26	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
bringing	1
glad	1
tidings	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
3	1
Nephi	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
did	1
also	1
pass	1
away	1
in	1
peace	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
who	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
who	1
did	1
infest	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
so	1
strong	1
were	1
their	1
holds	1
and	1
their	1
secret	1
places	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
could	1
not	1
overpower	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
commit	1
many	1
murders	1
and	1
did	1
do	1
much	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
128	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
increase	1
in	1
great	1
degree	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
dissenters	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
did	1
flee	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
did	1
cause	1
much	1
sorrow	1
unto	1
those	1
Nephites	1
who	1
did	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
129	1
29	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
much	1
sorrow	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
many	1
children	1
who	1
did	1
grow	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
years	1
that	1
they	1
became	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
were	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
some	1
who	1
were	1
Zoramites	1
by	1
their	1
lyings	1
and	1
their	1
flattering	1
words	1
to	1
join	1
those	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
3	1
Nephi	1
130	1
30	1
And	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
afflicted	1
also	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
decrease	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
righteousness	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
rising	1
generation	1

Chapter	1

Nephi	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
forget	1
those	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
astonished	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
or	1
a	1
wonder	1
from	1
heaven	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
hard	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
blind	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
all	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
3	1
Nephi	1
22	1
2	1
Imagining	1
up	1
some	1
vain	1
thing	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
wrought	1
by	1
men	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
to	1
lead	1
away	1
and	1
deceive	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
Satan	1
get	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
again	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
blind	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
lead	1
them	1
away	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ	1
was	1
a	1
foolish	1
and	1
a	1
vain	1
thing	1
3	1
Nephi	1
23	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
signs	1
or	1
wonders	1
given	1
and	1
Satan	1
did	1
go	1
about	1
leading	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
tempting	1
them	1
and	1
causing	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
great	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
thus	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
3	1
Nephi	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
also	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Mosiah	1
who	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
3	1
Nephi	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
six	1
hundred	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
3	1
Nephi	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
nine	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
sign	1
was	1
given	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
28	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
Nephites	1
began	1
to	1
reckon	1
their	1
time	1
from	1
this	1
period	1
when	1
the	1
sign	1
was	1
given	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
therefore	1
nine	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
Nephi	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Nephi	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
records	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
could	1
nowhere	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
210	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
still	1
remain	1
in	1
wickedness	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
much	1
preaching	1
and	1
prophesying	1
which	1
was	1
sent	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
also	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
iniquity	1
3	1
Nephi	1
211	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
wars	1
and	1
contentions	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
had	1
become	1
so	1
numerous	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
did	1
lay	1
waste	1
so	1
many	1
cities	1
and	1
did	1
spread	1
so	1
much	1
death	1
and	1
carnage	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
it	1
became	1
expedient	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
both	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
should	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
212	1
12	1
Therefore	1
all	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
unite	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
were	1
compelled	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
against	1
those	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
maintain	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
their	1
church	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
worship	1
and	1
their	1
freedom	1
and	1
their	1
liberty	1
3	1
Nephi	1
213	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
before	1
this	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
threatened	1
with	1
utter	1
destruction	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
war	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
3	1
Nephi	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
united	1
with	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
3	1
Nephi	1
215	1
15	1
And	1
their	1
curse	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
skin	1
became	1
white	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
3	1
Nephi	1
216	1
16	1
And	1
their	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
3	1
Nephi	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
the	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
robbers	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
continue	1
and	1
did	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
gain	1
some	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
robbers	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
drive	1
them	1
back	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
into	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
into	1
their	1
secret	1
places	1
3	1
Nephi	1
218	1
18	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
their	1
many	1
contentions	1
and	1
dissensions	1
the	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
did	1
gain	1
many	1
advantages	1
over	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
many	1
afflictions	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
destruction	1
did	1
hang	1
over	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
down	1
by	1
it	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1

And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
sixteenth	1

from	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Lachoneus	1
the	1

the	1

received	1
an	1
epistle	1
from	1
the	1
leader	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
band	1
of	1
robbers	1

these	1
were	1
the	1
words	1

were	1
written	1

Lachoneus	1
most	1

behold	1
I	1
write	1
this	1
epistle	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
do	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
praise	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
firmness	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
your	1
people	1
in	1
maintaining	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
suppose	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
right	1
and	1
liberty	1
yea	1
ye	1
do	1
stand	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
ye	1
were	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
god	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
your	1
liberty	1

your	1

that	1
which	1
ye	1

call	1

And	1
it	1
seemeth	1
a	1
pity	1
unto	1
me	1
most	1
noble	1
Lachoneus	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
foolish	1
and	1
vain	1
as	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
stand	1
against	1
so	1
many	1
brave	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
my	1
command	1
who	1
do	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
stand	1
in	1
their	1
arms	1

do	1
await	1
with	1
great	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1

down	1
upon	1

And	1
I	1
knowing	1
of	1
their	1
unconquerable	1

having	1
proved	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
and	1
knowing	1
of	1
their	1
everlasting	1
hatred	1
towards	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
wrongs	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
them	1
therefore	1
if	1
they	1
should	1

they	1
would	1
visit	1
you	1
with	1
utter	1
destruction	1

Therefore	1
I	1
have	1

epistle	1
sealing	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1

hand	1

for	1
your	1

because	1
of	1

unto	1

that	1
ye	1

up	1
unto	1
this	1
my	1
people	1
your	1
cities	1
your	1
lands	1
and	1
your	1
possessions	1
rather	1
than	1
that	1

and	1
that	1
destruction	1
should	1
come	1

in	1

unite	1

us	1
and	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
our	1
secret	1

become	1

that	1
ye	1

And	1
behold	1
I	1

unto	1

if	1
ye	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
I	1
swear	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
month	1
I	1
will	1
command	1
that	1
my	1
armies	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
stay	1
their	1
hand	1
and	1
shall	1
spare	1
not	1
but	1
shall	1
slay	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
let	1
fall	1
the	1
sword	1
upon	1
you	1
even	1
until	1
ye	1
shall	1
become	1
extinct	1
3	1
Nephi	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
Giddianhi	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
secret	1
society	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
which	1
society	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
thereof	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
ancient	1
date	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
unto	1
us	1
3	1
Nephi	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
I	1
write	1
this	1
epistle	1
unto	1
you	1
Lachoneus	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
deliver	1
up	1
your	1
lands	1
and	1
your	1
possessions	1
without	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
that	1
this	1
my	1
people	1
may	1
recover	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
government	1
who	1
have	1
dissented	1
away	1
from	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
wickedness	1
in	1
retaining	1
from	1
them	1
their	1
rights	1
of	1
government	1
and	1
except	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
their	1
wrongs	1
I	1
am	1
Giddianhi	1
3	1
Nephi	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Lachoneus	1
received	1
this	1
epistle	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
astonished	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
demanding	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
threatening	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
avenging	1
the	1
wrongs	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
no	1
wrong	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
they	1
had	1
wronged	1
themselves	1
by	1
dissenting	1
away	1
unto	1
those	1
wicked	1
and	1
abominable	1
robbers	1
3	1
Nephi	1
312	1
12	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
Lachoneus	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
frightened	1
by	1
the	1
demands	1
and	1
the	1
threatenings	1
of	1
a	1
robber	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
robbers	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
strength	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
robbers	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
313	1
13	1
Yea	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
proclamation	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
together	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
substance	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
their	1
land	1
unto	1
one	1
place	1
3	1
Nephi	1
314	1
14	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
fortifications	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
thereof	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
that	1
armies	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
or	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
who	1
were	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
as	1
guards	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
watch	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
robbers	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
3	1
Nephi	1
315	1
15	1
Yea	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
As	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
except	1
ye	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
iniquities	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
will	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
be	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
3	1
Nephi	1
316	1
16	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Lachoneus	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
fear	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
exert	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
might	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Lachoneus	1
3	1
Nephi	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lachoneus	1
did	1
appoint	1
chief	1
captains	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
command	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
robbers	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
against	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
318	1
18	1
Now	1
the	1
chiefest	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
captains	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
was	1
appointed	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Gidgiddoni	1
3	1
Nephi	1
319	1
19	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
appoint	1
for	1
their	1
chief	1
captains	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
times	1
of	1
wickedness	1
some	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revelation	1
and	1
also	1
prophecy	1
therefore	1
this	1
Gidgiddoni	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
among	1
them	1
as	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
3	1
Nephi	1
320	1
20	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Gidgiddoni	1
Pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
robbers	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
3	1
Nephi	1
321	1
21	1
But	1
Gidgiddoni	1
saith	1
unto	1
them	1
The	1
Lord	1
forbid	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
them	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
deliver	1
us	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
prepare	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
our	1
armies	1
together	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
against	1
them	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
wait	1
till	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
us	1
therefore	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
this	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
3	1
Nephi	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
the	1
proclamation	1
of	1
Lachoneus	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
their	1
chariots	1
and	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
their	1
grain	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
substance	1
and	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
by	1
thousands	1
and	1
by	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
3	1
Nephi	1
323	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
appointed	1
was	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
land	1
Zarahemla	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
yea	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
which	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
3	1
Nephi	1
324	1
24	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
thousand	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
who	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
Now	1
Lachoneus	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
curse	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
3	1
Nephi	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
fortify	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
dwell	1
in	1
one	1
land	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
fear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
Lachoneus	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
prayers	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
enemies	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
battle	1
3	1
Nephi	1
326	1
26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
And	1
Gidgiddoni	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
strong	1
with	1
armor	1
and	1
with	1
shields	1
and	1
with	1
bucklers	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
instruction	1

Chapter	1

Nephi	1
41	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
those	1
armies	1
of	1
robbers	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
battle	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
to	1
sally	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
hills	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
their	1
strongholds	1
and	1
their	1
secret	1
places	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
both	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
south	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
north	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
deserted	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
desolate	1
3	1
Nephi	1
42	1
2	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
wild	1
beasts	1
nor	1
game	1
in	1
those	1
lands	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
deserted	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
game	1
for	1
the	1
robbers	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
3	1
Nephi	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
robbers	1
could	1
not	1
exist	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
left	1
their	1
lands	1
desolate	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
substance	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
3	1
Nephi	1
44	1
4	1
Therefore	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
for	1
the	1
robbers	1
to	1
plunder	1
and	1
to	1
obtain	1
food	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
open	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Nephites	1
being	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
and	1
having	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
number	1
and	1
having	1
reserved	1
for	1
themselves	1
provisions	1
and	1
horses	1
and	1
cattle	1
and	1
flocks	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
subsist	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
seven	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
time	1
they	1
did	1
hope	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
robbers	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
45	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
Giddianhi	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
subsist	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
plunder	1
and	1
rob	1
and	1
murder	1
3	1
Nephi	1
46	1
6	1
And	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
spread	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
raise	1
grain	1
lest	1
the	1
Nephites	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
therefore	1
Giddianhi	1
gave	1
commandment	1
unto	1
his	1
armies	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
3	1
Nephi	1
47	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
and	1
behold	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
girded	1
about	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
robbers	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
lambskin	1
about	1
their	1
loins	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
dyed	1
in	1
blood	1
and	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
shorn	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
headplates	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
armor	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
dyed	1
in	1
blood	1
3	1
Nephi	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
had	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
did	1
lift	1
their	1
cries	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
spare	1
them	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
3	1
Nephi	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
saw	1
this	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
shout	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
joy	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
their	1
armies	1
3	1
Nephi	1
410	1
10	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
thing	1
they	1
were	1
disappointed	1
for	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
fear	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
did	1
supplicate	1
him	1
for	1
protection	1
therefore	1
when	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
did	1
rush	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
they	1
did	1
receive	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
411	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
commenced	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
battle	1
thereof	1
yea	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
slaughter	1
thereof	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
never	1
was	1
known	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
slaughter	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Lehi	1
since	1
he	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
3	1
Nephi	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
threatenings	1
and	1
the	1
oaths	1
which	1
Giddianhi	1
had	1
made	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
fall	1
back	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Gidgiddoni	1
commanded	1
that	1
his	1
armies	1
should	1
pursue	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
spare	1
any	1
that	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Gidgiddoni	1
3	1
Nephi	1
414	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Giddianhi	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
boldness	1
was	1
pursued	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
and	1
being	1
weary	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
much	1
fighting	1
he	1
was	1
overtaken	1
and	1
slain	1
And	1
thus	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
Giddianhi	1
the	1
robber	1
3	1
Nephi	1
415	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
place	1
of	1
security	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
this	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
robbers	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
come	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
3	1
Nephi	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
to	1
lay	1
siege	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
suppose	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
should	1
hem	1
them	1
in	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
their	1
outward	1
privileges	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
yield	1
themselves	1
up	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
wishes	1
3	1
Nephi	1
417	1
17	1
Now	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
unto	1
themselves	1
another	1
leader	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Zemnarihah	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
Zemnarihah	1
that	1
did	1
cause	1
that	1
this	1
siege	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
3	1
Nephi	1
418	1
18	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
an	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
Nephites	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
robbers	1
to	1
lay	1
siege	1
sufficiently	1
long	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
Nephites	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
much	1
provision	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
3	1
Nephi	1
419	1
19	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
scantiness	1
of	1
provisions	1
among	1
the	1
robbersfor	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
meat	1
for	1
their	1
subsistence	1
which	1
meat	1
they	1
did	1
obtain	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
3	1
Nephi	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
wild	1
game	1
became	1
scarce	1
in	1
the	1
wildernessinsomuch	1
that	1
the	1
robbers	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger	1
3	1
Nephi	1
421	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
continually	1
marching	1
out	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
falling	1
upon	1
their	1
armies	1
and	1
cutting	1
them	1
off	1
by	1
thousands	1
and	1
by	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
3	1
Nephi	1
422	1
22	1
And	1
thus	1
it	1
became	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Zemnarihah	1
to	1
withdraw	1
from	1
their	1
design	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
destruction	1
which	1
came	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
by	1
day	1
3	1
Nephi	1
423	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Zemnarihah	1
did	1
give	1
command	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
withdraw	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
siege	1
and	1
march	1
into	1
the	1
furthermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
3	1
Nephi	1
424	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
Gidgiddoni	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
design	1
and	1
knowing	1
of	1
their	1
weakness	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
slaughter	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
among	1
them	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
send	1
out	1
his	1
armies	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
and	1
did	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
their	1
retreat	1
and	1
did	1
place	1
his	1
armies	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
their	1
retreat	1
3	1
Nephi	1
425	1
25	1
And	1
this	1
did	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
nighttime	1
and	1
got	1
on	1
their	1
march	1
beyond	1
the	1
robbers	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
the	1
robbers	1
began	1
their	1
march	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
both	1
in	1
their	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
3	1
Nephi	1
426	1
26	1
And	1
the	1
robbers	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
were	1
also	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
of	1
retreat	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
command	1
of	1
Gidgiddoni	1
3	1
Nephi	1
427	1
27	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
thousands	1
who	1
did	1
yield	1
themselves	1
up	1
prisoners	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
slain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
428	1
28	1
And	1
their	1
leader	1
Zemnarihah	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
hanged	1
upon	1
a	1
tree	1
yea	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
hanged	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
they	1
did	1
fell	1
the	1
tree	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
did	1
cry	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
3	1
Nephi	1
429	1
29	1
May	1
the	1
Lord	1
preserve	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
in	1
holiness	1
of	1
heart	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
felled	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
all	1
who	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
secret	1
combinations	1
even	1
as	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
been	1
felled	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
430	1
30	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
rejoice	1
and	1
cry	1
again	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
saying	1
May	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
protect	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
righteousness	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
protection	1
3	1
Nephi	1
431	1
31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
break	1
forth	1
all	1
as	1
one	1
in	1
singing	1
and	1
praising	1
their	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
preserving	1
them	1
from	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
3	1
Nephi	1
432	1
32	1
Yea	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
God	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
God	1
3	1
Nephi	1
433	1
33	1
And	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
swollen	1
with	1
joy	1
unto	1
the	1
gushing	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
tears	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
delivering	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
repentance	1
and	1
their	1
humility	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
delivered	1
from	1
an	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1

Nephi	1
51	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
living	1
soul	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
did	1
doubt	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
3	1
Nephi	1
52	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
expedient	1
that	1
Christ	1
had	1
come	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
signs	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
already	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
3	1
Nephi	1
53	1
3	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
forsake	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
and	1
their	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
did	1
serve	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
3	1
Nephi	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
all	1
the	1
robbers	1
prisoners	1
insomuch	1
that	1
none	1
did	1
escape	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
slain	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
their	1
prisoners	1
into	1
prison	1
and	1
did	1
cause	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
murder	1
no	1
more	1
were	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
3	1
Nephi	1
55	1
5	1
But	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
and	1
who	1
did	1
still	1
continue	1
to	1
have	1
those	1
secret	1
murders	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
yea	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
found	1
breathing	1
out	1
threatenings	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
were	1
condemned	1
and	1
punished	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
3	1
Nephi	1
56	1
6	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
wicked	1
and	1
secret	1
and	1
abominable	1
combinations	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
wickedness	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
murders	1
committed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
57	1
7	1
And	1
thus	1
had	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fourth	1
and	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
and	1
thus	1
had	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
passed	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
there	1
had	1
many	1
things	1
transpired	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
some	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
cannot	1
all	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
yea	1
this	1
book	1
cannot	1
contain	1
even	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
done	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
3	1
Nephi	1
59	1
9	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
are	1
records	1
which	1
do	1
contain	1
all	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
shorter	1
but	1
true	1
account	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
Nephi	1
3	1
Nephi	1
510	1
10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
record	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
Nephi	1
which	1
was	1
engraven	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
which	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
3	1
Nephi	1
511	1
11	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
do	1
make	1
the	1
record	1
on	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hands	1
3	1
Nephi	1
512	1
12	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
Mormon	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Mormon	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
which	1
Alma	1
did	1
establish	1
the	1
church	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
yea	1
the	1
first	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
among	1
them	1
after	1
their	1
transgression	1
3	1
Nephi	1
513	1
13	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
word	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life	1
3	1
Nephi	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
hath	1
become	1
expedient	1
that	1
I	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
gone	1
hence	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
holy	1
ones	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
3	1
Nephi	1
515	1
15	1
Yea	1
a	1
small	1
record	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
taken	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Lehi	1
left	1
Jerusalem	1
even	1
down	1
until	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
3	1
Nephi	1
516	1
16	1
Therefore	1
I	1
do	1
make	1
my	1
record	1
from	1
the	1
accounts	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
me	1
until	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
my	1
day	1
3	1
Nephi	1
517	1
17	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
do	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
eyes	1
3	1
Nephi	1
518	1
18	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
just	1
and	1
a	1
true	1
record	1
nevertheless	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
things	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
language	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
write	1
3	1
Nephi	1
519	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
saying	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
proceed	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
520	1
20	1
I	1
am	1
Mormon	1
and	1
a	1
pure	1
descendant	1
of	1
Lehi	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
bless	1
my	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
Savior	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
it	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
himself	1
and	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
so	1
much	1
knowledge	1
unto	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
souls	1
3	1
Nephi	1
521	1
21	1
Surely	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
hath	1
been	1
merciful	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
3	1
Nephi	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
insomuch	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lehi	1
have	1
kept	1
his	1
commandments	1
he	1
hath	1
blessed	1
them	1
and	1
prospered	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
3	1
Nephi	1
523	1
23	1
Yea	1
and	1
surely	1
shall	1
he	1
again	1
bring	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
3	1
Nephi	1
524	1
24	1
And	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
liveth	1
will	1
he	1
gather	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob	1
who	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
525	1
25	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
covenanted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
covenant	1
wherewith	1
he	1
hath	1
covenanted	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
unto	1
the	1
restoring	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
covenanted	1
with	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
526	1
26	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
who	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
gathered	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
dispersed	1
yea	1
as	1

61	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
all	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1

sixth	1
year	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
his	1
flocks	1
and	1
his	1

his	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
cattle	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
did	1
belong	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
62	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
eaten	1
up	1
all	1
their	1
provisions	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
devoured	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
grain	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
and	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
precious	1
things	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
possessions	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
north	1

on	1

and	1
on	1
the	1

3	1
Nephi	1
63	1

And	1
they	1
granted	1
unto	1
those	1
robbers	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
who	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
remain	1
Lamanites	1
lands	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
numbers	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
with	1
their	1
labors	1
wherewith	1
to	1
subsist	1
upon	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
prosper	1
and	1
to	1
wax	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1

seventh	1
years	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
order	1
in	1
the	1

they	1
had	1
formed	1
their	1
laws	1
according	1
to	1
equity	1
and	1
justice	1
3	1
Nephi	1
65	1
5	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
prospering	1
continually	1
except	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
transgression	1
3	1
Nephi	1
66	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
Gidgiddoni	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
Lachoneus	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
leaders	1
who	1
had	1
established	1
this	1
great	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
cities	1
built	1
anew	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
old	1
cities	1
repaired	1
3	1
Nephi	1
68	1
8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
highways	1
cast	1
up	1
and	1
many	1
roads	1
made	1
which	1
led	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
and	1
from	1
land	1
to	1
land	1
and	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
3	1
Nephi	1
69	1
9	1
And	1
thus	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
continual	1
peace	1
3	1
Nephi	1
610	1
10	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
disputings	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
some	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
unto	1
pride	1
and	1
boastings	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
riches	1
yea	1
even	1
unto	1
great	1
persecutions	1
3	1
Nephi	1
611	1
11	1
For	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
merchants	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
lawyers	1
and	1
many	1
officers	1
3	1
Nephi	1
612	1
12	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
ranks	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
riches	1
and	1
their	1
chances	1
for	1
learning	1
yea	1
some	1
were	1
ignorant	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
poverty	1
and	1
others	1
did	1
receive	1
great	1
learning	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
riches	1
3	1
Nephi	1
613	1
13	1
Some	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
pride	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
humble	1
some	1
did	1
return	1
railing	1
for	1
railing	1
while	1
others	1
would	1
receive	1
railing	1
and	1
persecution	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
afflictions	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
turn	1
and	1
revile	1
again	1
but	1
were	1
humble	1
and	1
penitent	1
before	1
God	1
3	1
Nephi	1
614	1
14	1
And	1
thus	1
there	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
inequality	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
the	1
church	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
among	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
true	1
faith	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
it	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
firm	1
and	1
steadfast	1
and	1
immovable	1
willing	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
3	1
Nephi	1
615	1
15	1
Now	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
thisSatan	1
had	1
great	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
stirring	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
puffing	1
them	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
tempting	1
them	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
and	1
riches	1
and	1
the	1
vain	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
616	1
16	1
And	1
thus	1
Satan	1
did	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
therefore	1
they	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
peace	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
3	1
Nephi	1
617	1
17	1
And	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
yearthe	1
people	1
having	1
been	1
delivered	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
iniquity	1
he	1
desired	1
they	1
shouldand	1
thus	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
3	1
Nephi	1
618	1
18	1
Now	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
sin	1
ignorantly	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
concerning	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
unto	1
them	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
wilfully	1
rebel	1
against	1
God	1
3	1
Nephi	1
619	1
19	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Lachoneus	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Lachoneus	1
for	1
Lachoneus	1
did	1
fill	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
did	1
govern	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
year	1
3	1
Nephi	1
620	1
20	1
And	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
inspired	1
from	1
heaven	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
standing	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
preaching	1
and	1
testifying	1
boldly	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
testifying	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
redemption	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
make	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
testify	1
boldly	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
sufferings	1
3	1
Nephi	1
621	1
21	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
angry	1
were	1
chiefly	1
the	1
chief	1
judges	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
high	1
priests	1
and	1
lawyers	1
yea	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
lawyers	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
3	1
Nephi	1
622	1
22	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
lawyer	1
nor	1
judge	1
nor	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
condemn	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
death	1
save	1
their	1
condemnation	1
was	1
signed	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
623	1
23	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
Christ	1
who	1
testified	1
boldly	1
who	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
secretly	1
by	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
death	1
came	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
until	1
after	1
their	1
death	1
3	1
Nephi	1
624	1
24	1
Now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
except	1
they	1
had	1
power	1
from	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
625	1
25	1
Therefore	1
a	1
complaint	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
against	1
these	1
judges	1
who	1
had	1
condemned	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
death	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
3	1
Nephi	1
626	1
26	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
judge	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
627	1
27	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
those	1
judges	1
had	1
many	1
friends	1
and	1
kindreds	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
yea	1
even	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
lawyers	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priests	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
unite	1
with	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
those	1
judges	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
3	1
Nephi	1
628	1
28	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
yea	1
even	1
into	1
that	1
covenant	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
which	1
covenant	1
was	1
given	1
and	1
administered	1
by	1
the	1
devil	1
to	1
combine	1
against	1
all	1
righteousness	1
3	1
Nephi	1
629	1
29	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
combine	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
deliver	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guilty	1
of	1
murder	1
from	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
justice	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
administered	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
3	1
Nephi	1
630	1
30	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
at	1
defiance	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
covenant	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
governor	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
but	1
should	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
kings	1
3	1
Nephi	1
7	1
Chapter	1
7	1
3	1
Nephi	1
71	1
1	1
Now	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
establish	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
year	1
yea	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
destroy	1
upon	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
yea	1
did	1
murder	1
the	1
chief	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
divided	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
separate	1
one	1
from	1
another	1
into	1
tribes	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
his	1
kindred	1
and	1
friends	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
destroy	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
every	1
tribe	1
did	1
appoint	1
a	1
chief	1
or	1
a	1
leader	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
became	1
tribes	1
and	1
leaders	1
of	1
tribes	1
3	1
Nephi	1
74	1
4	1
Now	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
save	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
family	1
and	1
many	1
kindreds	1
and	1
friends	1
therefore	1
their	1
tribes	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
3	1
Nephi	1
75	1
5	1
Now	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
wars	1
as	1
yet	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
iniquity	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
yield	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
3	1
Nephi	1
76	1
6	1
And	1
the	1
regulations	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
were	1
destroyed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
combination	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
and	1
kindreds	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
murdered	1
the	1
prophets	1
3	1
Nephi	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
cause	1
a	1
great	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
righteous	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
nearly	1
all	1
become	1
wicked	1
yea	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
righteous	1
men	1
among	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
78	1
8	1
And	1
thus	1
six	1
years	1
had	1
not	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
their	1
righteousness	1
like	1
the	1
dog	1
to	1
his	1
vomit	1
or	1
like	1
the	1
sow	1
to	1
her	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
3	1
Nephi	1
79	1
9	1
Now	1
this	1
secret	1
combination	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
so	1
great	1
iniquity	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
did	1
place	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
did	1
call	1
Jacob	1
3	1
Nephi	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
call	1
him	1
their	1
king	1
therefore	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
this	1
wicked	1
band	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chiefest	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
voice	1
against	1
the	1
prophets	1
who	1
testified	1
of	1
Jesus	1
3	1
Nephi	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
strong	1
in	1
number	1
as	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
united	1
together	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
their	1
leaders	1
did	1
establish	1
their	1
laws	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
tribe	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
enemies	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
yet	1
they	1
were	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
government	1
3	1
Nephi	1
712	1
12	1
Therefore	1
Jacob	1
seeing	1
that	1
their	1
enemies	1
were	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
they	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
therefore	1
he	1
commanded	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
their	1
flight	1
into	1
the	1
northernmost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
there	1
build	1
up	1
unto	1
themselves	1
a	1
kingdom	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
dissenters	1
for	1
he	1
flattered	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
many	1
dissenters	1
and	1
they	1
become	1
sufficiently	1
strong	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
3	1
Nephi	1
713	1
13	1
And	1
so	1
speedy	1
was	1
their	1
march	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
impeded	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
thus	1
ended	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
3	1
Nephi	1
714	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
tribes	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
kindred	1
and	1
friends	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
agreement	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
war	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
united	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
laws	1
and	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
government	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
established	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
their	1
chiefs	1
and	1
their	1
leaders	1
But	1
they	1
did	1
establish	1
very	1
strict	1
laws	1
that	1
one	1
tribe	1
should	1
not	1
trespass	1
against	1
another	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
they	1
had	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
nevertheless	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
stone	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
715	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephihaving	1
been	1
visited	1
by	1
angels	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
having	1
seen	1
angels	1
and	1
being	1
eyewitness	1
and	1
having	1
had	1
power	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
concerning	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
also	1
being	1
eyewitness	1
to	1
their	1
quick	1
return	1
from	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
3	1
Nephi	1
716	1
16	1
Therefore	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
mindswent	1
forth	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
testify	1
boldly	1
repentance	1
and	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
through	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
3	1
Nephi	1
717	1
17	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
minister	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
not	1
suffice	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
And	1
Nephi	1
did	1
minister	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
authority	1
3	1
Nephi	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
even	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
greater	1
power	1
than	1
they	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
disbelieve	1
his	1
words	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
his	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
that	1
angels	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
him	1
daily	1
3	1
Nephi	1
719	1
19	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
did	1
he	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
and	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
and	1
even	1
his	1
brother	1
did	1
he	1
raise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
stoned	1
and	1
suffered	1
death	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
witness	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
were	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
also	1
do	1
many	1
more	1
miracles	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
3	1
Nephi	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
few	1
who	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
but	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
converted	1
did	1
truly	1
signify	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
visited	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
believed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
had	1
devils	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
were	1
healed	1
of	1
their	1
sicknesses	1
and	1
their	1
infirmities	1
did	1
truly	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
wrought	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
healed	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
show	1
forth	1
signs	1
also	1
and	1
did	1
do	1
some	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
723	1
23	1
Thus	1
passed	1
away	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
also	1
And	1
Nephi	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
repentance	1
and	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
3	1
Nephi	1
724	1
24	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
remember	1
also	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
who	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
repentance	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
baptized	1
with	1
water	1
3	1
Nephi	1
725	1
25	1
Therefore	1
there	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
Nephi	1
men	1
unto	1
this	1
ministry	1
that	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
water	1
and	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
and	1
a	1
testimony	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
repented	1
and	1
received	1
a	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
3	1
Nephi	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
that	1
were	1
baptized	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
8	1
Chapter	1
8	1
3	1
Nephi	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
record	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
our	1
record	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
recordfor	1
he	1
truly	1
did	1
many	1
miracles	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
do	1
a	1
miracle	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
save	1
he	1
were	1
cleansed	1
every	1
whit	1
from	1
his	1
iniquity	1
3	1
Nephi	1
82	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
this	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning	1
of	1
our	1
time	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
83	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
with	1
great	1
earnestness	1
for	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
yea	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
darkness	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
84	1
4	1
And	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
doubtings	1
and	1
disputations	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
notwithstanding	1
so	1
many	1
signs	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
3	1
Nephi	1
85	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
86	1
6	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
tempest	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
terrible	1
thunder	1
insomuch	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
shake	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
divide	1
asunder	1
3	1
Nephi	1
87	1
7	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
sharp	1
lightnings	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
88	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
did	1
take	1
fire	1
3	1
Nephi	1
89	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moroni	1
did	1
sink	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
were	1
drowned	1
3	1
Nephi	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
carried	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Moronihah	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
there	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
811	1
11	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
destruction	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
3	1
Nephi	1
812	1
12	1
But	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
more	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
destruction	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
changed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
tempest	1
and	1
the	1
whirlwinds	1
and	1
the	1
thunderings	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings	1
and	1
the	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
quaking	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
813	1
13	1
And	1
the	1
highways	1
were	1
broken	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
level	1
roads	1
were	1
spoiled	1
and	1
many	1
smooth	1
places	1
became	1
rough	1
3	1
Nephi	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
many	1
great	1
and	1
notable	1
cities	1
were	1
sunk	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
burned	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
shaken	1
till	1
the	1
buildings	1
thereof	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
were	1
slain	1
and	1
the	1
places	1
were	1
left	1
desolate	1
3	1
Nephi	1
815	1
15	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
cities	1
which	1
remained	1
but	1
the	1
damage	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
who	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
whither	1
they	1
went	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
save	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
817	1
17	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
became	1
deformed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
tempests	1
and	1
the	1
thunderings	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings	1
and	1
the	1
quaking	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
818	1
18	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
rocks	1
were	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
broken	1
fragments	1
and	1
in	1
seams	1
and	1
in	1
cracks	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
819	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
thunderings	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings	1
and	1
the	1
storm	1
and	1
the	1
tempest	1
and	1
the	1
quakings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
ceasefor	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
last	1
for	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
some	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
greater	1
nevertheless	1
all	1
these	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hoursand	1
then	1
behold	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
820	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
thick	1
darkness	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
vapor	1
of	1
darkness	1
3	1
Nephi	1
821	1
21	1
And	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
light	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
neither	1
candles	1
neither	1
torches	1
neither	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
fire	1
kindled	1
with	1
their	1
fine	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
dry	1
wood	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
light	1
at	1
all	1
3	1
Nephi	1
822	1
22	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
light	1
seen	1
neither	1
fire	1
nor	1
glimmer	1
neither	1
the	1
sun	1
nor	1
the	1
moon	1
nor	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
the	1
mists	1
of	1
darkness	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
823	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
last	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
light	1
seen	1
and	1
there	1
was	1

dispersed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
cease	1
to	1
tremble	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
did	1
cease	1
to	1
rend	1
and	1
the	1
dreadful	1
groanings	1
did	1
cease	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
tumultuous	1
noises	1
did	1
pass	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1010	1
10	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
cleave	1
together	1
again	1
that	1
it	1
stood	1
and	1
the	1
mourning	1
and	1
the	1
weeping	1
and	1
the	1
wailing	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
spared	1
alive	1
did	1
cease	1
and	1
their	1
mourning	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
joy	1
and	1
their	1
lamentations	1
into	1
the	1
praise	1
and	1
thanksgiving	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1011	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
far	1
were	1
the	1
scriptures	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1012	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
righteous	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
saved	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
stoned	1
them	1
not	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
who	1
were	1
spared	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1013	1
13	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
spared	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
sunk	1
and	1
buried	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
burned	1
by	1
fire	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
fallen	1
upon	1
and	1
crushed	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
carried	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
vapor	1
of	1
smoke	1
and	1
of	1
darkness	1
3	1
Nephi	1

And	1
now	1
whoso	1
readeth	1
let	1
him	1
understand	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
scriptures	1
let	1
him	1
search	1
them	1
and	1
see	1
and	1
behold	1
if	1
all	1
these	1

all	1
these	1

of	1

prophets	1
3	1

Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Yea	1
many	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
were	1
slain	1
because	1
they	1
testified	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1016	1
16	1
Yea	1
the	1
prophet	1
Zenos	1
did	1
testify	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
also	1
Zenock	1
spake	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
because	1
they	1
testified	1
particularly	1
concerning	1
us	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
their	1
seed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1017	1
17	1
Behold	1
our	1
father	1
Jacob	1
also	1
testified	1
concerning	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
And	1
behold	1
are	1
not	1
we	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
testify	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
brass	1
which	1
our	1
father	1
Lehi	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1018	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ending	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
who	1
were	1
spared	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
Lamanites	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
spared	1
did	1
have	1
great	1
favors	1
shown	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
great	1
blessings	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
their	1
heads	1
insomuch	1
that	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
ascension	1
of	1
Christ	1
into	1
heaven	1
he	1
did	1
truly	1
manifest	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1019	1
19	1
Showing	1
his	1
body	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
ministering	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
ministry	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
hereafter	1
Therefore	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
make	1
an	1

3	1
Nephi	1
111	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
gathered	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Bountiful	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
marveling	1
and	1
wondering	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
were	1
showing	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
change	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
3	1
Nephi	1
112	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
conversing	1
about	1
this	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
sign	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
concerning	1
his	1
death	1
3	1
Nephi	1
113	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
conversing	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
for	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
they	1
heard	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
harsh	1
voice	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
nevertheless	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
small	1
voice	1
it	1
did	1
pierce	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
hear	1
to	1
the	1
center	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
frame	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
to	1
quake	1
yea	1
it	1
did	1
pierce	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
soul	1
and	1
did	1
cause	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
burn	1
3	1
Nephi	1
114	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
again	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
they	1
understood	1
it	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
115	1
5	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
they	1
did	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
did	1
open	1
their	1
ears	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
towards	1
the	1
sound	1
thereof	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
look	1
steadfastly	1
towards	1
heaven	1
from	1
whence	1
the	1
sound	1
came	1
3	1
Nephi	1
116	1
6	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
they	1
did	1
understand	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
they	1
heard	1
and	1
it	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
117	1
7	1
Behold	1
my	1
Beloved	1
Son	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
glorified	1
my	1
namehear	1
ye	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
118	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
understood	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
eyes	1
up	1
again	1
towards	1
heaven	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
Man	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
robe	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
were	1
turned	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
open	1
their	1
mouths	1
even	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
for	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
that	1
had	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
119	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
saying	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1110	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
whom	1
the	1
prophets	1
testified	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1111	1
11	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
bitter	1
cup	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
and	1
have	1
glorified	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
taking	1
upon	1
me	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
they	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
prophesied	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
show	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
after	1
his	1
ascension	1
into	1
heaven	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1114	1
14	1
Arise	1
and	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
thrust	1
your	1
hands	1
into	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
feel	1
the	1
prints	1
of	1
the	1
nails	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
feet	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
multitude	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
thrust	1
their	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
did	1
feel	1
the	1
prints	1
of	1
the	1
nails	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
do	1
going	1
forth	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
feel	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
did	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
and	1
did	1
bear	1
record	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1116	1
16	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
forth	1
and	1
had	1
witnessed	1
for	1
themselves	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
out	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
saying	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1117	1
17	1
Hosanna	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Most	1
High	1
God	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
fall	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
did	1
worship	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1118	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
for	1
Nephi	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
forth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1119	1
19	1
And	1
Nephi	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
kiss	1
his	1
feet	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1120	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
arise	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1121	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
power	1
that	1

And	1
again	1
the	1
Lord	1
called	1
others	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
power	1
to	1
baptize	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
On	1
this	1
wise	1
shall	1

there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1

23	1
Verily	1

Ye	1

Therefore	1

Go	1

Behold	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
commandment	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
your	1
heart	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1230	1
30	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
deny	1
yourselves	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
wherein	1
ye	1
will	1
take	1
up	1
your	1
cross	1
than	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1

Nephi	1
1231	1
31	1
It	1
hath	1
been	1
written	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1232	1
32	1
Verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife	1
saving	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
fornication	1
causeth	1
her	1
to	1
commit	1
adultery	1
and	1
whoso	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
who	1
is	1
divorced	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1233	1
33	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forswear	1
thyself	1
but	1
shalt	1
perform	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
thine	1
oaths	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1234	1
34	1
But	1
verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
swear	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
Gods	1
throne	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1235	1
35	1
Nor	1
by	1
the	1

for	1
it	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1236	1
36	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
swear	1

thy	1

because	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
make	1
one	1
hair	1
black	1

white	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1237	1
37	1
But	1
let	1
your	1

be	1
Yea	1
yea	1
Nay	1
nay	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
cometh	1
of	1
more	1
than	1

evil	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1238	1
38	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1

an	1

and	1
a	1
tooth	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1239	1
39	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
resist	1
evil	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
on	1
thy	1

turn	1
to	1
him	1
the	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1240	1
40	1
And	1
if	1
any	1

will	1
sue	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1

let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1

also	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1241	1
41	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
compel	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
mile	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
twain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1242	1
42	1
Give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
asketh	1
thee	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
borrow	1
of	1
thee	1
turn	1
not	1
away	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1243	1
43	1
And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
also	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbor	1
and	1
hate	1
thine	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1244	1
44	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
love	1
your	1

bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1

pray	1
for	1

who	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you	1

persecute	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1245	1
45	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1

the	1

Therefore	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
of	1

time	1
which	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
law	1
in	1

are	1
all	1
fulfilled	1

Old	1

away	1
and	1
all	1

Nephi	1
1248	1
48	1
Therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
perfect	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
or	1
your	1

Verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1

unto	1

take	1

that	1
ye	1

ye	1

not	1
sound	1

before	1
you	1

will	1
hypocrites	1
do	1
in	1

in	1

that	1
they	1

unto	1
you	1
they	1

3	1
Nephi	1

But	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1

let	1
not	1
thy	1

hand	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
right	1

doeth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
134	1
4	1
That	1
thine	1

may	1
be	1
in	1

thy	1

who	1

3	1
Nephi	1
135	1

And	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
for	1
they	1
love	1
to	1
pray	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1

in	1
the	1

that	1
they	1

Verily	1

unto	1
you	1
they	1
have	1
their	1

But	1
thou	1
when	1

enter	1
into	1
thy	1

and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
shut	1
thy	1

pray	1
to	1
thy	1

But	1
when	1
ye	1

use	1
not	1
vain	1
repetitions	1
as	1
the	1
heathen	1
for	1
they	1
think	1

shall	1
be	1

3	1
Nephi	1

Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1

unto	1

for	1
your	1

After	1
this	1

ye	1
Our	1

Nephi	1
1311	1

And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1

as	1

Nephi	1
1312	1
12	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1

deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil	1

Nephi	1

For	1
thine	1

Amen	1

1314	1
14	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
men	1
their	1

your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
will	1
also	1
forgive	1
you	1

Nephi	1
1316	1
16	1
Moreover	1
when	1
ye	1
fast	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
of	1
a	1
sad	1
countenance	1
for	1
they	1

their	1

that	1
they	1
may	1

you	1

But	1

thy	1

wash	1
thy	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1318	1
18	1
That	1
thou	1
appear	1
not	1
unto	1

lay	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1

in	1

where	1
neither	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1321	1

For	1
where	1

there	1
will	1
your	1

The	1

if	1

thine	1

But	1
if	1
thine	1

that	1
darkness	1

No	1
man	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one	1

love	1
the	1

he	1

Mammon	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1325	1
25	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
twelve	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
For	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
they	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
body	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
life	1
more	1
than	1
meat	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
than	1
raiment	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1326	1
26	1
Behold	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
for	1
they	1
sow	1
not	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap	1
nor	1
gather	1
into	1
barns	1
yet	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1327	1
27	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
one	1
cubit	1
unto	1
his	1
stature	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1328	1
28	1
And	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
raiment	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
how	1
they	1
grow	1
they	1
toil	1
not	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
spin	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1329	1
29	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
even	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1330	1
30	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
which	1
today	1
is	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven	1
even	1
so	1
will	1
he	1
clothe	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
little	1
faith	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1331	1
31	1
Therefore	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
saying	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat	1
or	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink	1
or	1
Wherewithal	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
clothed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1332	1
32	1
For	1
your	1
heavenly	1

knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1333	1
33	1
But	1
seek	1
ye	1
first	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness	1
and	1
all	1
these	1

shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1334	1
34	1
Take	1
therefore	1
no	1

for	1
the	1

Therefore	1
all	1

Beware	1

Ye	1

Every	1

by	1

have	1
we	1
not	1

And	1
then	1

Therefore	1
whoso	1
heareth	1
these	1

doeth	1
them	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1

every	1

that	1
heareth	1

And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
ended	1
these	1
sayings	1
he	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
the	1

said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
taught	1
before	1
I	1
ascended	1
to	1
my	1

therefore	1
whoso	1
remembereth	1
these	1

I	1
raise	1
up	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
marveled	1
and	1
wondered	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
old	1
things	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
had	1
become	1
new	1
3	1
Nephi	1
153	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Marvel	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
old	1
things	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
had	1
become	1
new	1
3	1
Nephi	1
154	1
4	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
Moses	1
3	1
Nephi	1
155	1
5	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
gave	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
covenanted	1
with	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
therefore	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law	1
therefore	1
it	1
hath	1
an	1
end	1
3	1
Nephi	1

Behold	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1

for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
me	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
3	1
Nephi	1
157	1
7	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
old	1
things	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
I	1
do	1
not	1

are	1
to	1

158	1
8	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
fulfilled	1
but	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
Moses	1
hath	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
159	1
9	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
Look	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
endure	1
to	1
the	1

and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1

will	1
I	1
give	1
eternal	1
life	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1510	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
commandments	1
therefore	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1

the	1
prophets	1
for	1
they	1
truly	1
testified	1
of	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1511	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
those	1
twelve	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1512	1
12	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
disciples	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
light	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1513	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1514	1
14	1
And	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
given	1
me	1
commandment	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
it	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1515	1
15	1
Neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
given	1
me	1
commandment	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
unto	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
other	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
led	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1516	1
16	1
This	1
much	1
did	1
the	1
Father	1
command	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1517	1
17	1
That	1
other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
this	1

them	1
also	1
I	1
must	1
bring	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1

there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1518	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
stiffneckedness	1
and	1
unbelief	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
my	1
word	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
commanded	1
to	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1519	1
19	1
But	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
separated	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
of	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1520	1
20	1
And	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
tribes	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
separated	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1521	1
21	1
And	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
they	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
said	1
Other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have	1
which	1
are	1

shall	1
be	1

Nephi	1
1522	1

And	1
they	1
understood	1
me	1
not	1
for	1
they	1
supposed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
for	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1

Gentiles	1
should	1
be	1
converted	1
through	1
their	1
preaching	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1523	1
23	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
me	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1

and	1
they	1

at	1
any	1
time	1
manifested	1
myself	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
163	1

But	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
my	1
sheep	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
fold	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd	1
therefore	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
show	1
myself	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
164	1
4	1
And	1
I	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
these	1
sayings	1
after	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
me	1
and	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
ministry	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
tribes	1
whom	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
of	1
that	1
these	1
sayings	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
manifested	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
their	1
seed	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
me	1
their	1
Redeemer	1
3	1
Nephi	1
165	1
5	1
And	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
them	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
fulfill	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
3	1
Nephi	1
166	1
6	1
And	1
blessed	1
are	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
me	1
in	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
167	1
7	1
Behold	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
unbelief	1
of	1
you	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
truth	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
the	1

things	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1

But	1
wo	1
saith	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
of	1

Gentilesfor	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
forth	1
upon	1

trodden	1
under	1

169	1

And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
also	1
the	1

verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1

Israel	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1

to	1
be	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1610	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
commandeth	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
sin	1
against	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
shall	1
reject	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
above	1
all	1
nations	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
lyings	1
and	1
of	1
deceits	1
and	1
of	1
mischiefs	1
and	1
all	1

of	1
hypocrisy	1

murders	1

priestcrafts	1
and	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
of	1

if	1

do	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
and	1
shall	1
reject	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
my	1

behold	1
saith	1
the	1
Father	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1

from	1
among	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1611	1
11	1
And	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1

I	1
will	1
bring	1
my	1
gospel	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1612	1
12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
thee	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant	1
unto	1
you	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1

But	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
will	1
repent	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Father	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1614	1

And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
among	1

and	1
tread	1
them	1
down	1
saith	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1615	1

But	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
voice	1
I	1
will	1
suffer	1
them	1
yea	1
I	1
will	1
suffer	1
my	1

O	1

that	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
through	1
among	1
them	1

shall	1
tread	1

down	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
salt	1
that	1
hath	1
lost	1
its	1

which	1
is	1
thenceforth	1
good	1
for	1
nothing	1

to	1

And	1

1	1
Behold	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
again	1
on	1
the	1

he	1

unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
my	1

is	1
at	1
hand	1
3	1
Nephi	1
172	1
2	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
weak	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
understand	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
commanded	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
3	1
Nephi	1
173	1
3	1
Therefore	1
go	1
ye	1
unto	1
your	1
homes	1
and	1
ponder	1
upon	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
and	1
prepare	1
your	1
minds	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
3	1
Nephi	1
174	1
4	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
show	1
myself	1
unto	1
the	1
lost	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
lost	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
he	1
knoweth	1
whither	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
175	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken	1
he	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
multitude	1
and	1
beheld	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
tears	1
and	1
did	1
look	1
steadfastly	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
with	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
176	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
my	1
bowels	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
compassion	1
towards	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
177	1
7	1
Have	1
ye	1
any	1
that	1

Bring	1

Have	1
ye	1
any	1
that	1

in	1
any	1

Bring	1
them	1
hither	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
them	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
you	1
my	1

filled	1

3	1
Nephi	1
178	1
8	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
ye	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
sufficient	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
179	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
their	1
sick	1
and	1
their	1
afflicted	1
and	1
their	1
lame	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
blind	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
dumb	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
afflicted	1
in	1
any	1
manner	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
heal	1
them	1
every	1
one	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
forth	1
unto	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1710	1
10	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
both	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
healed	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
whole	1
bow	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
did	1
worship	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
could	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
did	1
kiss	1
his	1
feet	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
bathe	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
their	1
tears	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
that	1
their	1
little	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1712	1
12	1
So	1
they	1
brought	1
their	1
little	1
children	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
gave	1
way	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1713	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
brought	1
and	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kneel	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1714	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
knelt	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
Jesus	1
groaned	1
within	1
himself	1
and	1
said	1
Father	1
I	1
am	1
troubled	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1715	1
15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
himself	1
also	1
knelt	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
prayed	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
did	1
bear	1
record	1
who	1
heard	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1716	1
16	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
do	1
they	1
bear	1
record	1
The	1
eye	1
hath	1
never	1
seen	1
neither	1
hath	1
the	1
ear	1
heard	1
before	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
Jesus	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1

an	1

Blessed	1

when	1

Verily	1
verily	1
I	1

unto	1
you	1
ye	1

always	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
tempted	1
by	1

ye	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1816	1
16	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
prayed	1
among	1
you	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
pray	1
in	1
my	1
church	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
who	1

example	1
for	1
you	1
3	1

And	1
it	1

he	1
turned	1
again	1

1818	1
18	1
Behold	1
verily	1

I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
ye	1
must	1
watch	1

pray	1
always	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation	1
for	1
Satan	1
desireth	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sift	1
you	1
as	1
wheat	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1819	1
19	1
Therefore	1
ye	1
must	1

pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1820	1
20	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
behold	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1821	1
21	1
Pray	1
in	1
your	1

unto	1
the	1
Father	1
always	1
in	1
my	1

that	1
your	1

may	1
be	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1822	1
22	1
And	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
meet	1
together	1
oft	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
forbid	1
any	1
man	1
from	1
coming	1
unto	1
you	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
meet	1
together	1

suffer	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1823	1
23	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
and	1
if	1
it	1

be	1
that	1

Therefore	1
hold	1
up	1

Behold	1

Behold	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
ye	1
all	1
have	1
witnessed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1825	1
25	1
And	1
ye	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
go	1
away	1
but	1
rather	1
have	1
commanded	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
feel	1
and	1
see	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
whosoever	1
breaketh	1
this	1
commandment	1
suffereth	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
temptation	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1826	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1

whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1827	1
27	1
Behold	1
verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
another	1
commandment	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
Father	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
fulfil	1
other	1
commandments	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1828	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
commandment	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
any	1
one	1
knowingly	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
unworthily	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
minister	1
it	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1829	1
29	1
For	1
whoso	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
unworthily	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
his	1
soul	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
unworthy	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
ye	1
shall	1
forbid	1
him	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1830	1
30	1
Nevertheless	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
repenteth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive	1
him	1
and	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1831	1
31	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
repent	1
not	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
destroy	1
my	1

know	1
my	1

and	1
they	1
are	1

3	1
Nephi	1
1832	1
32	1
Nevertheless	1
ye	1
shall	1

out	1
of	1
your	1
synagogues	1

they	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
repent	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
full	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
heal	1
them	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
salvation	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1833	1
33	1
Therefore	1
keep	1
these	1
sayings	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
under	1
condemnation	1
for	1
wo	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
condemneth	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1834	1
34	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
these	1
commandments	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
disputations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
among	1
you	1
And	1
blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
disputations	1
among	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1835	1
35	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1836	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
sayings	1
he	1
touched	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
disciples	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
even	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
touched	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
touched	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
1837	1
37	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
therefore	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
bear	1
record	1
but	1
the	1
disciples	1
bare	1
record	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
hereafter	1
that	1
this	1
record	1
is	1
true	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
touched	1
them	1
all	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
cloud	1

overshadowed	1

And	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
overshadowed	1
he	1

from	1

ascended	1
into	1

And	1

And	1

Nevertheless	1
so	1

So	1
great	1
faith	1
have	1
I	1
never	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1

the	1

that	1

should	1
cease	1

And	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
he	1
brake	1
bread	1
again	1

blessed	1
it	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1

to	1
eat	1

Nephi	1

And	1
when	1
they	1

eaten	1
he	1
commanded	1

break	1
bread	1

give	1
unto	1

205	1

And	1
when	1

also	1
gave	1

Now	1

But	1

to	1

For	1
it	1
is	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
this	1

and	1
be	1
set	1
up	1
as	1
a	1

Therefore	1

these	1
works	1

the	1

among	1
you	1
hereafter	1

For	1
thus	1

that	1

should	1
come	1
forth	1

that	1

may	1
show	1

that	1
the	1

if	1

not	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1

may	1

And	1
when	1

shall	1
come	1

For	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
the	1
Father	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
marvelous	1
work	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
them	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
although	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1

But	1
behold	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
him	1
although	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
marred	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
him	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
my	1
wisdom	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
cunning	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2111	1
11	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1

that	1
whosoever	1

not	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
words	1
who	1

forth	1
unto	1

it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
even	1
as	1
Moses	1
said	1

it	1
shall	1
come	1

throw	1
down	1
all	1

And	1
I	1
will	1

now	1
behold	1
I	1

unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
search	1
these	1
things	1
Yea	1
a	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
search	1
these	1
things	1
diligently	1
for	1
great	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
3	1
Nephi	1
232	1
2	1
For	1
surely	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
touching	1
all	1
things	1
concerning	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
therefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
speak	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
3	1
Nephi	1
233	1
3	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
3	1
Nephi	1
234	1
4	1
Therefore	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
my	1
words	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1

they	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1

And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
repenteth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
the	1

shall	1
be	1
saved	1
Search	1

that	1

of	1
these	1

And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1

again	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
expounded	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
other	1
scriptures	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
write	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
237	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Nephi	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
kept	1
3	1
Nephi	1
238	1
8	1
And	1
when	1
Nephi	1
had	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
said	1
3	1
Nephi	1
239	1
9	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
commanded	1
my	1
servant	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
testify	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
should	1
glorify	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
saints	1
who	1
should	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
should	1
appear	1
unto	1
many	1
and	1
should	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2310	1
10	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
Yea	1
Lord	1
Samuel	1
did	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
fulfilled	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2311	1
11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
How	1
be	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
written	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
many	1
saints	1
did	1
arise	1

appear	1
unto	1
many	1
and	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2312	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
remembered	1
that	1
this	1
thing	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
written	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2313	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jesus	1
commanded	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2314	1
14	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
expounded	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
in	1
one	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
written	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1

Nephi	1
241	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
write	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
had	1
given	1
unto	1
Malachi	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
tell	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
written	1
he	1
expounded	1
them	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
tell	1
unto	1
them	1
saying	1
Thus	1
said	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
MalachiBehold	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
temple	1
even	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
whom	1
ye	1
delight	1
in	1
behold	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Hosts	1
3	1
Nephi	1
242	1

But	1
who	1
may	1
abide	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
stand	1
when	1
he	1
appeareth	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
refiners	1
fire	1
and	1
like	1
fullers	1
soap	1
3	1
Nephi	1
243	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
refiner	1
and	1
purifier	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
and	1
purge	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
righteousness	1
3	1
Nephi	1

Then	1
shall	1
the	1

of	1
Judah	1

Jerusalem	1
be	1
pleasant	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1

as	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
3	1
Nephi	1

5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
judgment	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1

against	1
the	1

against	1
the	1

his	1

Nephi	1
246	1

For	1
I	1
am	1

And	1
I	1

Ye	1

the	1

If	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
the	1

if	1

who	1
was	1
before	1

began	1
3	1
Nephi	1
266	1

And	1
now	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
even	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did	1
truly	1
teach	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
267	1
7	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
do	1
contain	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
268	1
8	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
which	1
are	1
a	1
lesser	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
spoken	1
3	1
Nephi	1
269	1
9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
received	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
first	1
to	1
try	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
shall	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
believe	1
these	1
things	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
greater	1
things	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2610	1
10	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
these	1
things	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
greater	1
things	1
be	1
withheld	1
from	1
them	1
unto	1
their	1
condemnation	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2611	1
11	1
Behold	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write	1
them	1
all	1
which	1
were	1
engraven	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
forbade	1
it	1
saying	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2612	1
12	1
Therefore	1
I	1
Mormon	1
do	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
commanded	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
sayings	1
and	1
proceed	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
commanded	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2613	1
13	1
Therefore	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
behold	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
truly	1
did	1
teach	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
show	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
oft	1
and	1
did	1
break	1
bread	1
oft	1
and	1
bless	1
it	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2614	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
teach	1
and	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
whom	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
loose	1
their	1
tongues	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
revealed	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
loosed	1
their	1
tongues	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
utter	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2615	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
ascended	1
into	1
heaventhe	1
second	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
after	1
having	1
healed	1
all	1
their	1
sick	1
and	1
their	1
lame	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
their	1
blind	1
and	1
unstopped	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
deaf	1
and	1
even	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
cures	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
raised	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1

had	1

unto	1
them	1

had	1
ascended	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2616	1
16	1
Behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
that	1
the	1
multitude	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
these	1
children	1
yea	1
even	1
babes	1
did	1
open	1
their	1
mouths	1
and	1
utter	1
marvelous	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
utter	1
were	1
forbidden	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
any	1

Nephi	1
2617	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
disciples	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
had	1
chosen	1
began	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
baptize	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
did	1

them	1

as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1

Jesus	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1

And	1
many	1

which	1
are	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1

And	1
they	1

And	1
it	1
came	1

all	1
things	1
even	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
commanded	1

3	1

And	1
they	1

were	1
preaching	1
the	1

seen	1
and	1
were	1
baptizing	1
in	1
the	1

it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1

were	1
united	1
in	1
mighty	1
prayer	1

fasting	1
3	1
Nephi	1

And	1
Jesus	1

Jesus	1
came	1

stood	1
in	1

of	1

said	1
unto	1
them	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
273	1

And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Lord	1
we	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
name	1
whereby	1
we	1
shall	1
call	1
this	1

there	1
are	1
disputations	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
3	1
Nephi	1
274	1
4	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
should	1
murmur	1
and	1
dispute	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
3	1
Nephi	1
275	1
5	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
scriptures	1
which	1
say	1
ye	1
must	1
take	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
is	1
my	1
name	1
For	1
by	1
this	1
name	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
3	1
Nephi	1
276	1

And	1
whoso	1
taketh	1
upon	1
him	1
my	1

endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1

shall	1
be	1
saved	1
at	1
the	1

3	1

277	1
7	1
Therefore	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
my	1

therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1

in	1
my	1

ye	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1

how	1
be	1
it	1
my	1

it	1

For	1
if	1
a	1
church	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
Moses	1

then	1
it	1
be	1
Moses	1
church	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
called	1
in	1

of	1
a	1

then	1
it	1
be	1
the	1

but	1
if	1
it	1

called	1
in	1
my	1

then	1
it	1
is	1

Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
built	1
upon	1
my	1
gospel	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
call	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
ye	1
do	1
call	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
therefore	1
if	1
ye	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
the	1
church	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
the	1
Father	1
will	1
hear	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2710	1
10	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
built	1
upon	1
my	1
gospel	1
then	1
will	1
the	1
Father	1
show	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
works	1
in	1
it	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2711	1
11	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
built	1
upon	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
is	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
they	1
have	1
joy	1
in	1
their	1
works	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
cometh	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
from	1
whence	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
return	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2712	1
12	1
For	1
their	1
works	1
do	1
follow	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
works	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
hewn	1
down	1
therefore	1
remember	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2713	1
13	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
youthat	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
because	1
my	1
Father	1
sent	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2714	1
14	1
And	1
my	1
Father	1
sent	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
lifted	1
up	1
by	1
men	1
even	1
so	1
should	1
men	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
Father	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
their	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
evil	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2715	1
15	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
lifted	1
up	1
therefore	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2716	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whoso	1
repenteth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
behold	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
hold	1
guiltless	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
stand	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2717	1
17	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
endureth	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
also	1
hewn	1
down	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
return	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2718	1
18	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
fulfilleth	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
and	1
he	1
lieth	1
not	1
but	1
fulfilleth	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2719	1
19	1
And	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing	1
can	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
entereth	1
into	1
his	1
rest	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
washed	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
my	1
blood	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
the	1
repentance	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
faithfulness	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2720	1
20	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
commandment	1
Repent	1
all	1
ye	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
that	1
ye	1

Verily	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
do	1
in	1
my	1
church	1
for	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1

Therefore	1
if	1
ye	1

these	1
things	1

ye	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1

3	1
Nephi	1
2723	1
23	1
Write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
forbidden	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2724	1
24	1
Write	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
hath	1
been	1
written	1
of	1
that	1

Nephi	1
2725	1
25	1
For	1
behold	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
and	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
shall	1
this	1
people	1
be	1
judged	1
for	1
by	1
them	1
shall	1
their	1
works	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
men	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2726	1
26	1
And	1
behold	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
Father	1
therefore	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
shall	1
the	1
world	1
be	1
judged	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2727	1
27	1
And	1
know	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
judges	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
just	1
Therefore	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
be	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2728	1
28	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
And	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1

unto	1
you	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2729	1
29	1
Therefore	1
ask	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1

3	1
Nephi	1
2730	1
30	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
great	1
even	1
unto	1
fulness	1
because	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
also	1
this	1
generation	1
yea	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
rejoiceth	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
angels	1
because	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
this	1
generation	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
lost	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2731	1
31	1
Behold	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
understand	1
for	1
I	1
mean	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
now	1
alive	1
of	1
this	1
generation	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
lost	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
I	1
have	1
fulness	1
of	1
joy	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2732	1
32	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
sorroweth	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
from	1
this	1
generation	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
sell	1
me	1
for	1
silver	1
and	1
for	1
gold	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
moth	1
doth	1
corrupt	1
and	1
which	1
thieves	1
can	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
steal	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
visit	1
them	1
even	1
in	1
turning	1
their	1
works	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
heads	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2733	1
33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
ended	1
these	1
sayings	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
Enter	1
ye	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate	1
for	1
strait	1
is	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
narrow	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
leads	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
few	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
find	1
it	1
but	1
wide	1
is	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
broad	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
leads	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
many	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
travel	1
therein	1
until	1
the	1
night	1
cometh	1
wherein	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
work	1
3	1
Nephi	1
28	1
Chapter	1
28	1
3	1
Nephi	1
281	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
desire	1
of	1
me	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
282	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
spake	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
three	1
saying	1
We	1
desire	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
have	1
lived	1
unto	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
our	1
ministry	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
called	1
us	1
may	1
have	1
an	1
end	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
speedily	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
3	1
Nephi	1
283	1
3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
because	1
ye	1
desired	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
me	1
therefore	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
seventy	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom	1
and	1
with	1
me	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
3	1
Nephi	1
284	1
4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
turned	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
285	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
sorrowed	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
for	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
desired	1
3	1
Nephi	1
286	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Behold	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
thoughts	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
desired	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
John	1
my	1
beloved	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
ministry	1
before	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
Jews	1
desired	1
of	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
287	1
7	1
Therefore	1
more	1
blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
to	1
behold	1
all	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
until	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
glory	1
with	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
heaven	1
3	1
Nephi	1
288	1
8	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
endure	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
glory	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye	1
from	1
mortality	1
to	1
immortality	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
3	1
Nephi	1
289	1
9	1
And	1
again	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
pain	1
while	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
neither	1
sorrow	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
desired	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
desired	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
bring	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
unto	1
me	1
while	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
stand	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2810	1
10	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
fulness	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
yea	1
your	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
fulness	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
even	1
as	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
touched	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
three	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
tarry	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
departed	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2813	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
opened	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
heaven	1
and	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
unspeakable	1
things	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2814	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
forbidden	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
utter	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
power	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
utter	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2815	1
15	1
And	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
for	1
it	1
did	1
seem	1
unto	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
transfiguration	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
changed	1
from	1
this	1
body	1
of	1
flesh	1
into	1
an	1
immortal	1
state	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
behold	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2816	1
16	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
again	1
minister	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
them	1
in	1
heaven	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2817	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
mortal	1
or	1
immortal	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
transfiguration	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2818	1
18	1
But	1
this	1
much	1
I	1
know	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
giventhey	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
uniting	1
as	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
as	1
would	1
believe	1
in	1
their	1
preaching	1
baptizing	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
did	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2819	1
19	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
by	1
them	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
And	1
the	1
prisons	1
could	1
not	1
hold	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2820	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
earth	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
insomuch	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
they	1
were	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
dig	1
pits	1
sufficient	1
to	1
hold	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2821	1
21	1
And	1
thrice	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
furnace	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
harm	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2822	1
22	1
And	1
twice	1
were	1
they	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
wild	1
beasts	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
with	1
a	1
suckling	1
lamb	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
harm	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2823	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
did	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
all	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
were	1
united	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
generation	1
were	1
blessed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Jesus	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2824	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2825	1
25	1
Behold	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
never	1
to	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
the	1
Lord	1
forbade	1
therefore	1
I	1
write	1
them	1
not	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2826	1
26	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2827	1
27	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2828	1
28	1
They	1
will	1
also	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
not	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2829	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
seeth	1
fit	1
in	1
his	1
wisdom	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
scattered	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
nations	1
kindreds	1
tongues	1
and	1
people	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
many	1
souls	1
that	1
their	1
desire	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
convincing	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2830	1
30	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
they	1
can	1
show	1
themselves	1
unto	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
it	1
seemeth	1
them	1
good	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2831	1
31	1
Therefore	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
works	1
shall	1
be	1
wrought	1
by	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
coming	1
day	1
when	1
all	1
people	1
must	1
surely	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Christ	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2832	1
32	1
Yea	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
work	1
wrought	1
by	1
them	1
before	1
that	1
judgment	1
day	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2833	1
33	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
which	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
marvelous	1
works	1
of	1
Christ	1
ye	1
would	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
surely	1
come	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2834	1
34	1
And	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
and	1
sent	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
whoso	1
receiveth	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
receiveth	1
not	1
him	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2835	1
35	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born	1
For	1
do	1
ye	1
suppose	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
an	1
offended	1
God	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
trampled	1
under	1
feet	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
thereby	1
salvation	1
might	1
come	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2836	1
36	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
as	1
I	1
spake	1
concerning	1
those	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
chosen	1
yea	1
even	1
three	1
who	1
were	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
heavens	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
cleansed	1
from	1
mortality	1
to	1
immortality	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2837	1
37	1
But	1
behold	1
since	1
I	1
wrote	1
I	1
have	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
change	1
wrought	1
upon	1
their	1
bodies	1
or	1
else	1
it	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2838	1
38	1
Therefore	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
change	1
wrought	1
upon	1
their	1
bodies	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
suffer	1
pain	1
nor	1
sorrow	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2839	1
39	1
Now	1
this	1
change	1
was	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
take	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
change	1
wrought	1
upon	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Satan	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tempt	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sanctified	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
holy	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
could	1
not	1
hold	1
them	1
3	1
Nephi	1
2840	1
40	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
judgment	1
day	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
greater	1
change	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out	1
but	1
to	1
dwell	1
eternally	1
in	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
see	1
fit	1
in	1
his	1
wisdom	1
that	1
these	1
sayings	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
then	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
concerning	1
their	1
restoration	1
to	1
the	1

is	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
3	1
Nephi	1
292	1
2	1
And	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
delays	1
his	1
coming	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
3	1
Nephi	1
293	1
3	1
And	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
imagine	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
are	1
vain	1
for	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
remember	1
his	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
3	1
Nephi	1
294	1
4	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
these	1
sayings	1
coming	1
forth	1
among	1
you	1
then	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
spurn	1
at	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
justice	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
behold	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
spurn	1
at	1
his	1
doings	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
soon	1
overtake	1
you	1
3	1

Wo	1
unto	1

that	1

at	1
the	1

shall	1
deny	1

that	1
shall	1

Yea	1

wo	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
shall	1
say	1
at	1
that	1

to	1
get	1
gain	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
miracle	1
wrought	1
by	1

for	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
this	1
shall	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1

perdition	1

there	1
was	1
no	1

Yea	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
any	1

hiss	1

make	1

of	1

of	1

behold	1
the	1

remembereth	1
his	1

Therefore	1

An	1

people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
record	1
4	1
Nephi	1
11	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
fifth	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
church	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
all	1
the	1

And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
did	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
truly	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1

were	1
baptized	1

also	1
receive	1
the	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
converted	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
both	1
Nephites	1
and	1

and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
contentions	1

disputations	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
deal	1
justly	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
4	1
Nephi	1
13	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common	1
among	1
them	1
therefore	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
rich	1
and	1
poor	1
bond	1
and	1
free	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
made	1
free	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift	1
4	1
Nephi	1
14	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
passed	1
away	1
also	1
and	1
there	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
4	1
Nephi	1
15	1
5	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
works	1
wrought	1
by	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
heal	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
raise	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
cause	1
the	1
lame	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
sight	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
miracles	1
did	1
they	1
work	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1

in	1
nothing	1
did	1
they	1
work	1

were	1
in	1
the	1

And	1
thus	1
did	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
ninth	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
forty	1

even	1
until	1
forty	1

had	1
passed	1

and	1
also	1
the	1
fifty	1
and	1

and	1
the	1

fifty	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
4	1
Nephi	1
17	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
prosper	1
them	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
build	1
cities	1
again	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
cities	1
burned	1
4	1

Yea	1
even	1
that	1

city	1

did	1
they	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
again	1
4	1

19	1
9	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
cities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
sunk	1
and	1
waters	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
thereof	1
therefore	1
these	1
cities	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
renewed	1
4	1
Nephi	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
did	1
wax	1
strong	1
and	1
did	1
multiply	1
exceedingly	1
fast	1
and	1
became	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
and	1
delightsome	1
people	1
4	1
Nephi	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
married	1
and	1
given	1
in	1
marriage	1
and	1
were	1
blessed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
promises	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
made	1
unto	1
them	1
4	1
Nephi	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
the	1
performances	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
commandments	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
their	1
Lord	1
and	1
their	1
God	1
continuing	1
in	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer	1
and	1
in	1
meeting	1
together	1
oft	1
both	1
to	1
pray	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
4	1
Nephi	1
113	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
4	1
Nephi	1
114	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
yea	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
till	1
the	1
seventy	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
yea	1
even	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
three	1
who	1
should	1
tarry	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
disciples	1
ordained	1
in	1
their	1
stead	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
of	1
that	1
generation	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
4	1
Nephi	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
did	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
4	1
Nephi	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
envyings	1
nor	1
strifes	1
nor	1
tumults	1
nor	1
whoredoms	1
nor	1
lyings	1
nor	1
murders	1
nor	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
lasciviousness	1
and	1
surely	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
happier	1
people	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
4	1
Nephi	1
117	1
17	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
robbers	1
nor	1
murderers	1
neither	1
were	1
there	1
Lamanites	1
nor	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
ites	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
heirs	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
4	1
Nephi	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
how	1
blessed	1
were	1
they	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
bless	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
doings	1
yea	1
even	1
they	1
were	1
blessed	1
and	1
prospered	1
until	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
generation	1
from	1
Christ	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
contention	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
4	1
Nephi	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nephi	1
he	1
that	1
kept	1
this	1
last	1
record	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
died	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Amos	1
kept	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
also	1
4	1
Nephi	1
120	1
20	1
And	1
he	1
kept	1
it	1
eighty	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
revolted	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
taken	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
Lamanites	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
4	1
Nephi	1
121	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Amos	1
died	1
also	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Amos	1
kept	1
the	1
record	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
kept	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Nephi	1
which	1
is	1
this	1
book	1
4	1
Nephi	1
122	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
two	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
generation	1
had	1
all	1
passed	1
away	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
few	1
4	1
Nephi	1
123	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
multiplied	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
spread	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
prosperity	1
in	1
Christ	1
4	1
Nephi	1
124	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
them	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
pride	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
wearing	1
of	1
costly	1
apparel	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fine	1
pearls	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fine	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
4	1
Nephi	1
125	1
25	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
their	1
goods	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
no	1
more	1
common	1
among	1
them	1
4	1
Nephi	1
126	1
26	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
classes	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
churches	1
unto	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
true	1
church	1
of	1
Christ	1
4	1
Nephi	1
127	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
churches	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
churches	1
which	1
professed	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
Christ	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
did	1
deny	1
the	1
more	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
gospel	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
receive	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
did	1
administer	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sacred	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
forbidden	1
because	1
of	1
unworthiness	1
4	1
Nephi	1
128	1
28	1
And	1
this	1
church	1
did	1
multiply	1
exceedingly	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
who	1
did	1
get	1
hold	1
upon	1
their	1
hearts	1
4	1
Nephi	1
129	1
29	1
And	1
again	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
church	1
which	1
denied	1
the	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
persecute	1
the	1
true	1
church	1
of	1
Christ	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
humility	1
and	1
their	1
belief	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
despise	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
miracles	1
which	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
them	1
4	1
Nephi	1
130	1
30	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
exercise	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
who	1
did	1
tarry	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
prisons	1
were	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
doing	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
among	1
them	1
4	1
Nephi	1
131	1
31	1
Nevertheless	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
these	1
miracles	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
did	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Jews	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
Jesus	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
4	1
Nephi	1
132	1
32	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
furnaces	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
receiving	1
no	1
harm	1
4	1
Nephi	1
133	1
33	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
dens	1
of	1
wild	1
beasts	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
with	1
a	1
lamb	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
receiving	1
no	1

Nephi	1
134	1
34	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
many	1
priests	1
and	1
false	1
prophets	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
many	1
churches	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
smite	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Jesus	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Jesus	1
did	1
not	1
smite	1
again	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
wickedness	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
even	1
until	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
4	1
Nephi	1
135	1
35	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
yea	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
4	1
Nephi	1
136	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
true	1
believers	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
there	1
were	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
LamanitesJacobites	1
and	1
Josephites	1
and	1
Zoramites	1
4	1
Nephi	1
137	1
37	1
Therefore	1
the	1
true	1
believers	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
worshipers	1
of	1
Christ	1
among	1
whom	1
were	1
the	1
three	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
who	1
should	1
tarry	1
were	1
called	1
Nephites	1
and	1
Jacobites	1
and	1
Josephites	1
and	1
Zoramites	1
4	1
Nephi	1
138	1
38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
rejected	1
the	1
gospel	1
were	1
called	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
Lemuelites	1
and	1
Ishmaelites	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
wilfully	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
teach	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
believe	1
even	1
as	1
their	1
fathers	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
did	1
dwindle	1
4	1
Nephi	1
139	1
39	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abomination	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
to	1
hate	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
taught	1
to	1
hate	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Nephi	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
4	1
Nephi	1
140	1
40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
wax	1
strong	1
and	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God	1
4	1
Nephi	1
141	1
41	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
still	1
continue	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
churches	1
unto	1
themselves	1
and	1
adorn	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
And	1
thus	1
did	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
also	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
years	1
4	1
Nephi	1
142	1
42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
the	1
secret	1
oaths	1
and	1
combinations	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
4	1
Nephi	1
143	1
43	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
and	1
become	1
vain	1
like	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
4	1
Nephi	1
144	1
44	1
And	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
disciples	1
began	1
to	1
sorrow	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
4	1
Nephi	1
145	1
45	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
three	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
both	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
wicked	1
one	1
like	1
unto	1
another	1
4	1
Nephi	1
146	1
46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
did	1
spread	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
that	1
were	1
righteous	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
And	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
did	1
they	1
lay	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
in	1
abundance	1
and	1
did	1
traffic	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
traffic	1
4	1
Nephi	1
147	1
47	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
still	1
remain	1
in	1
wickedness	1
Amos	1
died	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Ammaron	1
did	1
keep	1
the	1
record	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
4	1
Nephi	1
148	1
48	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
Ammaron	1
being	1
constrained	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
did	1
hide	1
up	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
were	1
sacredyea	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
sacred	1
records	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
from	1

to	1
generation	1

the	1
three	1

from	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
4	1
Nephi	1
149	1
49	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
hide	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
Jacob	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

THE	1
BOOK	1
OF	1

1	1
Chapter	1
1	1
Mormon	1
11	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
and	1
call	1
it	1
the	1
Book	1
of	1
Mormon	1
Mormon	1
12	1
2	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Ammaron	1
hid	1
up	1
the	1
records	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
being	1
about	1
ten	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
learned	1
somewhat	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
learning	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
Ammaron	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
sober	1
child	1
and	1
art	1
quick	1
to	1
observe	1
Mormon	1
13	1
3	1
Therefore	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
about	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
old	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
observed	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
that	1
age	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
Antum	1
unto	1
a	1
hill	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Shim	1
and	1
there	1
have	1
I	1
deposited	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
all	1
the	1
sacred	1
engravings	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
Mormon	1
14	1
4	1
And	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
unto	1
yourself	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
shall	1
ye	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
engrave	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
observed	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
Mormon	1
15	1
5	1
And	1
I	1
Mormon	1
being	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
my	1
fathers	1
name	1
was	1
Mormon	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Ammaron	1
commanded	1
me	1
Mormon	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
being	1
eleven	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
Mormon	1
17	1
7	1
The	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
become	1
covered	1
with	1
buildings	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
as	1
numerous	1
almost	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
Mormon	1
18	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Jacobites	1
and	1
the	1
Josephites	1
and	1
the	1
Zoramites	1
and	1
this	1
war	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Lemuelites	1
and	1
the	1
Ishmaelites	1
Mormon	1
19	1
9	1
Now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
Lemuelites	1
and	1
the	1
Ishmaelites	1
were	1
called	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
parties	1
were	1
Nephites	1
and	1
Lamanites	1
Mormon	1
110	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Zarahemla	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sidon	1
Mormon	1
111	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
to	1
exceed	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
year	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
battles	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
beat	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
Mormon	1
112	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
withdrew	1
their	1
design	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
peace	1
did	1
remain	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
about	1
four	1
years	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bloodshed	1
Mormon	1
113	1
13	1
But	1
wickedness	1
did	1
prevail	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
beloved	1
disciples	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
miracles	1
and	1
of	1
healing	1
did	1
cease	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Mormon	1
114	1
14	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
gifts	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
any	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
unbelief	1
Mormon	1
115	1
15	1
And	1
I	1
being	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
and	1
being	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
sober	1
mind	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
visited	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
tasted	1
and	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Mormon	1
116	1
16	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
endeavor	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
but	1
my	1
mouth	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
forbidden	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
behold	1
they	1
had	1
wilfully	1
rebelled	1
against	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
beloved	1
disciples	1
were	1
taken	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
Mormon	1
117	1
17	1
But	1
I	1
did	1
remain	1
among	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
forbidden	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
cursed	1
for	1
their	1
sake	1
Mormon	1
118	1
18	1
And	1
these	1
Gadianton	1
robbers	1
who	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
infest	1
the	1
land	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
began	1
to	1
hide	1
up	1
their	1
treasures	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
slippery	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
cursed	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hold	1
them	1
nor	1
retain	1
them	1
again	1
Mormon	1
119	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
sorceries	1
and	1
witchcrafts	1
and	1
magics	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
one	1
was	1
wrought	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Abinadi	1
and	1
also	1
Samuel	1
the	1
Lamanite	1
Mormon	1
2	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Mormon	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
war	1
again	1
between	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
I	1
being	1
young	1
was	1
large	1
in	1
stature	1
therefore	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
appointed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
leader	1
or	1
the	1
leader	1
of	1
their	1
armies	1
Mormon	1
22	1
2	1
Therefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
sixteenth	1
year	1
I	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
therefore	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
had	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
power	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
frighten	1
my	1
armies	1
therefore	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
fight	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
retreat	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
countries	1
Mormon	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Angola	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
make	1
preparations	1
to	1
defend	1
ourselves	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
fortify	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
our	1
might	1
but	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
our	1
fortifications	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
did	1
drive	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Mormon	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
drive	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
David	1
Mormon	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
we	1
marched	1
forth	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Joshua	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
west	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
Mormon	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
gather	1
in	1
our	1
people	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
get	1
them	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
Mormon	1
28	1
8	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
robbers	1
and	1
with	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
great	1
destruction	1
which	1
hung	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
doings	1
therefore	1
there	1
was	1
blood	1
and	1
carnage	1
spread	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
complete	1
revolution	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Aaron	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
against	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
withstood	1
him	1
with	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
beat	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
army	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
before	1
me	1
And	1
behold	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
Mormon	1
210	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
began	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
even	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
prophesied	1
by	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet	1
for	1
behold	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
for	1
the	1
thieves	1
and	1
the	1
robbers	1
and	1
the	1
murderers	1
and	1
the	1
magic	1
art	1
and	1
the	1
witchcraft	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
211	1
11	1
Thus	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mourning	1
and	1
a	1
lamentation	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mormon	1
212	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
Mormon	1
saw	1
their	1
lamentation	1
and	1
their	1
mourning	1
and	1
their	1
sorrow	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
my	1
heart	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
rejoice	1
within	1
me	1
knowing	1
the	1
mercies	1
and	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
therefore	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
again	1
become	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
Mormon	1
213	1
13	1
But	1
behold	1
this	1
my	1
joy	1
was	1
vain	1
for	1
their	1
sorrowing	1
was	1
not	1
unto	1
repentance	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
the	1
sorrowing	1
of	1
the	1
damned	1
because	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
always	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
happiness	1
in	1
sin	1
Mormon	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
with	1
broken	1
hearts	1
and	1
contrite	1
spirits	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
curse	1
God	1
and	1
wish	1
to	1
die	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
would	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
for	1
their	1
lives	1
Mormon	1
215	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
sorrow	1
did	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
again	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
grace	1
was	1
passed	1
with	1
them	1
both	1
temporally	1
and	1
spiritually	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
hewn	1
down	1
in	1
open	1
rebellion	1
against	1
their	1
God	1
and	1
heaped	1
up	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
thus	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
Mormon	1
216	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
pursued	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jashon	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
stop	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
retreat	1
Mormon	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jashon	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
Ammaron	1
had	1
deposited	1
the	1
records	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Ammaron	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
did	1
make	1
a	1
record	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ammaron	1
Mormon	1
218	1
18	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
I	1
did	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
but	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
I	1
did	1
forbear	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
for	1
behold	1
a	1
continual	1
scene	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
has	1
been	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
sufficient	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
man	1
Mormon	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
wo	1
is	1
me	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
for	1
my	1
heart	1
has	1
been	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
all	1
my	1
days	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Mormon	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
again	1
were	1
hunted	1
and	1
driven	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
until	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
northward	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Shem	1
Mormon	1
221	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
fortify	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Shem	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
gather	1
in	1
our	1
people	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
that	1
perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
save	1
them	1
from	1
destruction	1
Mormon	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
again	1
Mormon	1
223	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
speak	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
did	1
urge	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
energy	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
stand	1
boldly	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
fight	1
for	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
their	1
homes	1
Mormon	1
224	1
24	1
And	1
my	1
words	1
did	1
arouse	1
them	1
somewhat	1
to	1
vigor	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
flee	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
did	1
stand	1
with	1
boldness	1
against	1
them	1
Mormon	1
225	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
contend	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
against	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
stand	1
before	1
them	1
with	1
such	1
firmness	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
from	1
before	1
us	1
Mormon	1
226	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fled	1
we	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
with	1
our	1
armies	1
and	1
did	1
meet	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
us	1
yea	1
we	1
were	1
left	1
to	1
ourselves	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
not	1
abide	1
in	1
us	1
therefore	1
we	1
had	1
become	1
weak	1
like	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
Mormon	1
227	1
27	1
And	1
my	1
heart	1
did	1
sorrow	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
great	1
calamity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
But	1
behold	1
we	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
until	1
we	1
had	1
again	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
Mormon	1
228	1
28	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
we	1
made	1
a	1
treaty	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
Gadianton	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
get	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
divided	1
Mormon	1
229	1
29	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
land	1
northward	1
yea	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
narrow	1
passage	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
Mormon	1
3	1
Chapter	1

Mormon	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
again	1
until	1
ten	1
years	1
more	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
had	1
employed	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
in	1
preparing	1
their	1
lands	1
and	1
their	1
arms	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
battle	1
Mormon	1
32	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
Cry	1
unto	1
this	1
peopleRepent	1
ye	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
baptized	1
and	1
build	1
up	1
again	1
my	1
church	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
spared	1
Mormon	1
33	1

And	1
I	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
had	1
spared	1
them	1
and	1
granted	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
repentance	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Mormon	1
34	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
this	1
tenth	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
making	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
sent	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
me	1
which	1
gave	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
preparing	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
us	1
Mormon	1
35	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
narrow	1
pass	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
southward	1
Mormon	1
36	1
6	1
And	1
there	1
we	1
did	1
place	1
our	1
armies	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
stop	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
get	1
possession	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
lands	1
therefore	1
we	1
did	1
fortify	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
force	1
Mormon	1
37	1

And	1
it	1

that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1

sixty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Desolation	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
us	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
year	1
we	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
lands	1
again	1

And	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
and	1
second	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
dead	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
Mormon	1
39	1

And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
thing	1
which	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
had	1
done	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
boast	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
swear	1
before	1
the	1
heavens	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
avenge	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
their	1
enemies	1
Mormon	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
would	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
Mormon	1
did	1
utterly	1
refuse	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
commander	1
and	1
a	1
leader	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abomination	1
Mormon	1
312	1
12	1
Behold	1
I	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
wickedness	1
I	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
many	1
times	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
loved	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
had	1
been	1
poured	1
out	1
in	1
prayer	1
unto	1
my	1
God	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
for	1
them	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
faith	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
Mormon	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
thrice	1
have	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
Mormon	1
314	1
14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sworn	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forbidden	1
them	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Savior	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
their	1
enemies	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
avenge	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Mormon	1
315	1
15	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
mine	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
and	1
because	1
this	1
people	1
repented	1
not	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Mormon	1
316	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
utterly	1
refused	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
mine	1
enemies	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
stand	1
as	1
an	1
idle	1
witness	1
to	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
had	1
testified	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
Mormon	1

Therefore	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
you	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
when	1
the	1
work	1
shall	1
commence	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
about	1
to	1
prepare	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
inheritance	1
Mormon	1
318	1
18	1
Yea	1
behold	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
yea	1
unto	1
you	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works	1
by	1
the	1
twelve	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
disciples	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
Mormon	1
319	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
write	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
shall	1
also	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
twelve	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
chose	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
twelve	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
chose	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
Mormon	1
320	1
20	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
doth	1
the	1
Spirit	1
manifest	1
unto	1
me	1
therefore	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Christ	1
yea	1
every	1
soul	1
who	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
family	1
of	1
Adam	1
and	1
ye	1
must	1
stand	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
your	1
works	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
Mormon	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
among	1
you	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
the	1
covenant	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
have	1
other	1
witness	1
besides	1
him	1
whom	1
they	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
they	1
slew	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
Mormon	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
persuade	1
all	1
ye	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
repent	1
and	1
prepare	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
and	1
third	1
year	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
Mormon	1
42	1
2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Desolation	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
weary	1
a	1
fresh	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
sore	1
battle	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Desolation	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
many	1
prisoners	1
Mormon	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
did	1
flee	1
and	1
join	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
Now	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
near	1
the	1
city	1
Desolation	1
Mormon	1
44	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
for	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
Mormon	1
45	1
5	1
But	1
behold	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
overtake	1
the	1
wicked	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
wicked	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
punished	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
wicked	1
that	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
unto	1
bloodshed	1
Mormon	1
46	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
make	1
preparations	1
to	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
Mormon	1
47	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
and	1
fourth	1
year	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
also	1
Mormon	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
repulsed	1
and	1
driven	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Nephites	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
they	1
did	1
again	1
boast	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
strength	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
might	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Desolation	1
Mormon	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
thousands	1
slain	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
both	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mormon	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
came	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
Nephites	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
Nephites	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
but	1
persisted	1
in	1
their	1
wickedness	1
continually	1
Mormon	1
411	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
tongue	1
to	1
describe	1
or	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
perfect	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
carnage	1
which	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
every	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
delighted	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
continually	1
Mormon	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
there	1
never	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
great	1
wickedness	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Lehi	1
nor	1
even	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
was	1
among	1
this	1
people	1
Mormon	1
413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Desolation	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
their	1
number	1
did	1
exceed	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Mormon	1
414	1
14	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
march	1
forward	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
Teancum	1
and	1
did	1
drive	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
many	1
prisoners	1
both	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
did	1
offer	1
them	1
up	1
as	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
their	1
idol	1
gods	1
Mormon	1
415	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
the	1
Nephites	1
being	1
angry	1
because	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
anger	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
beat	1
again	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
lands	1
Mormon	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
until	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy	1
and	1
fifth	1
year	1
Mormon	1
417	1
17	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
year	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
Nephites	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
powers	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
numbered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
Mormon	1
418	1
18	1
And	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
did	1
the	1
Nephites	1
gain	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
but	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
swept	1
off	1
by	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
dew	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
Mormon	1
419	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
Desolation	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
battle	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Desolation	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
beat	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Mormon	1
420	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
fled	1
again	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Boaz	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
did	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
with	1
exceeding	1
boldness	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
beat	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
Mormon	1
421	1
21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
driven	1
and	1
slaughtered	1
with	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
slaughter	1
their	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
were	1
again	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols	1
Mormon	1
422	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Nephites	1
did	1
again	1
flee	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
taking	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
with	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
Mormon	1
423	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
land	1
therefore	1
I	1
did	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
Shim	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
up	1
all	1
the	1

hid	1
up	1
unto	1

And	1
it	1
came	1

that	1
I	1
did	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
did	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
assist	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
me	1
command	1
again	1
of	1
their	1
armies	1
for	1
they	1
looked	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
could	1
deliver	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
afflictions	1
Mormon	1
52	1
2	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
was	1
without	1
hope	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
but	1
did	1
struggle	1
for	1
their	1
lives	1
without	1
calling	1
upon	1
that	1
Being	1
who	1
created	1
them	1
Mormon	1
53	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
against	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jordan	1
but	1
behold	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
Mormon	1
54	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
against	1
us	1
again	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
maintain	1
the	1
city	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
other	1
cities	1
which	1
were	1
maintained	1
by	1
Nephites	1
which	1
strongholds	1
did	1
cut	1
them	1
off	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
our	1
land	1
Mormon	1
55	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
lands	1
we	1
had	1
passed	1
by	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
were	1
not	1
gathered	1
in	1
were	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
their	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
and	1
cities	1
were	1
burned	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
thus	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
passed	1
away	1
Mormon	1
56	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
eightieth	1
year	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
come	1
again	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
stand	1
against	1
them	1
boldly	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
their	1
numbers	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
tread	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
Mormon	1
57	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
again	1
take	1
to	1
flight	1
and	1
those	1
whose	1
flight	1
was	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
escape	1
and	1
those	1
whose	1
flight	1
did	1
not	1
exceed	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
were	1
swept	1
down	1
and	1
destroyed	1
Mormon	1
58	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
Mormon	1
do	1
not	1
desire	1
to	1
harrow	1
up	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
casting	1
before	1
them	1
such	1
an	1
awful	1
scene	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
carnage	1
as	1
was	1
laid	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes	1
but	1
I	1
knowing	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
surely	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
hid	1
must	1
be	1
revealed	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops	1
Mormon	1
59	1
9	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
who	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
said	1
should	1
scatter	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
should	1
be	1
counted	1
as	1
naught	1
among	1
themtherefore	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
small	1
abridgment	1
daring	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
too	1
great	1
sorrow	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
Mormon	1
510	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
their	1
seed	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
who	1
have	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
realize	1
and	1
know	1
from	1
whence	1
their	1
blessings	1
come	1
Mormon	1
511	1
11	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
such	1
will	1
sorrow	1
for	1
the	1
calamity	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
yea	1
they	1
will	1
sorrow	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
they	1
will	1
sorrow	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
had	1
not	1
repented	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
clasped	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Mormon	1
512	1
12	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
written	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
wickedness	1
will	1
not	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
hid	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
forth	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
Mormon	1
513	1
13	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
commandment	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
fit	1
in	1
his	1
wisdom	1
Mormon	1
514	1
14	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
shall	1
they	1
gothat	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
may	1
bring	1
about	1
through	1
his	1
most	1
Beloved	1
his	1
great	1
and	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
in	1
restoring	1
the	1
Jews	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
his	1
covenant	1
Mormon	1
515	1
15	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
may	1
more	1
fully	1
believe	1
his	1
gospel	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
for	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
and	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
dark	1
a	1
filthy	1
and	1
a	1
loathsome	1
people	1
beyond	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ever	1
hath	1
been	1
amongst	1
us	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief	1
and	1
idolatry	1
Mormon	1
516	1
16	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
already	1
ceased	1
to	1
strive	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
Christ	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
driven	1
about	1
as	1
chaff	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
Mormon	1
517	1
17	1
They	1
were	1
once	1
a	1
delightsome	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
Christ	1
for	1
their	1
shepherd	1
yea	1
they	1
were	1
led	1
even	1
by	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
Mormon	1
518	1
18	1
But	1
now	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
led	1
about	1
by	1
Satan	1
even	1
as	1
chaff	1
is	1
driven	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
is	1
tossed	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
waves	1
without	1
sail	1
or	1
anchor	1
or	1
without	1
anything	1
wherewith	1
to	1
steer	1
her	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
are	1
they	1
Mormon	1
519	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
reserved	1
their	1
blessings	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
who	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
520	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
and	1
scattered	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
driven	1
and	1
scattered	1
by	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
behold	1
then	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
remember	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
Mormon	1
521	1
21	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
up	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
Mormon	1
522	1
22	1
And	1
then	1
O	1
ye	1
Gentiles	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
except	1
ye	1
shall	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways	1
Mormon	1
523	1
23	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
great	1
command	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
rolled	1
together	1
as	1
a	1
scroll	1
Mormon	1
524	1
24	1
Therefore	1
repent	1
ye	1
and	1
humble	1
yourselves	1
before	1
him	1
lest	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
justice	1
against	1
youlest	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
among	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
and	1
tear	1
you	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1

Chapter	1

Mormon	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
finish	1
my	1
record	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
before	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mormon	1
62	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
Mormon	1
wrote	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
gather	1
together	1
our	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Cumorah	1
by	1
a	1
hill	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Cumorah	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
battle	1
Mormon	1
63	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
grant	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
desired	1
Mormon	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Cumorah	1
and	1
we	1
did	1
pitch	1
our	1
tents	1
around	1
about	1
the	1
hill	1
Cumorah	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
many	1
waters	1
rivers	1
and	1
fountains	1
and	1
here	1
we	1
had	1
hope	1
to	1
gain	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Mormon	1
65	1
5	1
And	1
when	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighty	1
and	1
four	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
we	1
had	1
gathered	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Cumorah	1
Mormon	1
66	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
gathered	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
people	1
in	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Cumorah	1
behold	1
I	1
Mormon	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
knowing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
struggle	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
commanded	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
by	1
our	1
fathers	1
which	1
were	1
sacred	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
for	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
would	1
destroy	1
them	1
therefore	1
I	1
made	1
this	1
record	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
hid	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
Cumorah	1
all	1
the	1
records	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
these	1
few	1
plates	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
Moroni	1
Mormon	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
with	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
did	1
now	1
behold	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
marching	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
awful	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
fills	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
did	1
they	1
await	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
Mormon	1
68	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
us	1
and	1
every	1
soul	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
terror	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
numbers	1
Mormon	1
69	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
fall	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
arrow	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
ax	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
Mormon	1
610	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
my	1
men	1
were	1
hewn	1
down	1
yea	1
even	1
my	1
ten	1
thousand	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
and	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
life	1
Mormon	1
611	1
11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
and	1
hewn	1
down	1
all	1
my	1
people	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
of	1
us	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
my	1
son	1
Moroni	1
and	1
we	1
having	1
survived	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
did	1
behold	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
returned	1
unto	1
their	1
camps	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
Cumorah	1
the	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
hewn	1
down	1
being	1
led	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
by	1
me	1
Mormon	1
612	1
12	1
And	1
we	1
also	1
beheld	1
the	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
led	1
by	1
my	1
son	1
Moroni	1
Mormon	1
613	1
13	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
Gidgiddonah	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
Mormon	1
614	1
14	1
And	1
Lamah	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
his	1
ten	1
thousand	1
and	1
Gilgal	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
his	1
ten	1
thousand	1
and	1
Limhah	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
his	1
ten	1
thousand	1
and	1
Jeneum	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
his	1
ten	1
thousand	1
and	1
Cumenihah	1
and	1
Moronihah	1
and	1
Antionum	1
and	1
Shiblom	1
and	1
Shem	1
and	1
Josh	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
their	1
ten	1
thousand	1
each	1
Mormon	1
615	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
ten	1
more	1
who	1
did	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
with	1
their	1
ten	1
thousand	1
each	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
my	1
people	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
those	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
had	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
south	1
countries	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
had	1
deserted	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
and	1
bones	1
and	1
blood	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
being	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
slew	1
them	1
to	1
molder	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
crumble	1
and	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
earth	1
Mormon	1
616	1
16	1
And	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
rent	1
with	1
anguish	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
Mormon	1
617	1
17	1
O	1
ye	1
fair	1
ones	1
how	1
could	1
ye	1
have	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
O	1
ye	1
fair	1
ones	1
how	1
could	1
ye	1
have	1
rejected	1
that	1
Jesus	1
who	1
stood	1
with	1
open	1
arms	1
to	1
receive	1
you	1
Mormon	1
618	1
18	1
Behold	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
this	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
fallen	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
fallen	1
and	1
I	1
mourn	1
your	1
loss	1
Mormon	1
619	1
19	1
O	1
ye	1
fair	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
ye	1
fathers	1
and	1
mothers	1
ye	1
husbands	1
and	1
wives	1
ye	1
fair	1
ones	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
could	1
have	1
fallen	1
Mormon	1
620	1
20	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
and	1
my	1
sorrows	1
cannot	1
bring	1
your	1
return	1
Mormon	1
621	1
21	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
soon	1
cometh	1
that	1
your	1
mortal	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
immortality	1
and	1
these	1
bodies	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
moldering	1
in	1
corruption	1
must	1
soon	1
become	1
incorruptible	1
bodies	1
and	1
then	1
ye	1
must	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Christ	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
righteous	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
blessed	1
with	1
your	1
fathers	1
who	1
have	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
Mormon	1
622	1
22	1
O	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
repented	1
before	1
this	1
great	1
destruction	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
But	1
behold	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
yea	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
of	1
heaven	1
knoweth	1
your	1
state	1
and	1

doeth	1
with	1

And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
spared	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
my	1
words	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
yea	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
ye	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
speak	1
Mormon	1

Know	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
the	1

Mormon	1
73	1

Know	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
come	1
unto	1
repentance	1
or	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
Mormon	1
74	1

Know	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
lay	1
down	1
your	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
delight	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
not	1
again	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
God	1
shall	1
command	1
you	1
Mormon	1
75	1
5	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
and	1
repent	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
he	1
hath	1
risen	1
again	1
whereby	1
he	1
hath	1
gained	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
the	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
swallowed	1
up	1
Mormon	1
76	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
whereby	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
judgmentseat	1
Mormon	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
whereby	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
found	1
guiltless	1
before	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
judgment	1
day	1
hath	1
it	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom	1
to	1
sing	1
ceaseless	1
praises	1
with	1
the	1
choirs	1
above	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
are	1
one	1

in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
hath	1
no	1
end	1
Mormon	1
78	1

Therefore	1
repent	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
record	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
from	1
the	1

which	1

For	1
behold	1
this	1

written	1
for	1
the	1

that	1
ye	1

that	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1

that	1
ye	1
will	1
believe	1
this	1
also	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
this	1
ye	1
will	1
know	1
concerning	1
your	1

also	1
the	1

were	1
wrought	1
by	1
the	1

God	1
among	1
them	1

And	1
ye	1

also	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
covenant	1
and	1
if	1
it	1

that	1
ye	1

baptized	1
first	1
with	1
water	1

with	1

Behold	1
I	1
Moroni	1
do	1
finish	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Mormon	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
but	1
few	1
things	1
to	1
write	1
which	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
commanded	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
Mormon	1
82	1

And	1
now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
tremendous	1
battle	1
at	1
Cumorah	1
behold	1
the	1
Nephites	1
who	1
had	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
southward	1
were	1
hunted	1
by	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
destroyed	1
Mormon	1
83	1

And	1
my	1
father	1
also	1
was	1
killed	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
even	1
remain	1
alone	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
sad	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
But	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
and	1
I	1
fulfil	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
And	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
slay	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
Mormon	1
84	1

Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
and	1
hide	1
up	1
the	1
records	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
it	1
mattereth	1

Mormon	1
85	1

Behold	1
my	1
father	1
hath	1
made	1
this	1
record	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
written	1
the	1
intent	1
thereof	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
would	1
write	1
it	1
also	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
room	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
and	1
ore	1
I	1
have	1
none	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
alone	1
My	1
father	1
hath	1
been	1
slain	1
in	1
battle	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
kinsfolk	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
friends	1
nor	1
whither	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
suffer	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
live	1
I	1
know	1

Mormon	1
86	1

Behold	1
four	1

away	1
since	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Savior	1
Mormon	1
87	1

And	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
hunted	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
down	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
and	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
even	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
great	1
has	1
been	1
their	1
fall	1
yea	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
is	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Mormon	1
88	1

And	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
hath	1
done	1
it	1
And	1
behold	1
also	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
at	1
war	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
is	1
one	1
continual	1
round	1
of	1
murder	1

bloodshed	1
and	1
no	1

knoweth	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
Mormon	1
89	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
concerning	1
them	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
Lamanites	1

that	1
do	1
exist	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
none	1
that	1
do	1
know	1
the	1
true	1
God	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Jesus	1
who	1
did	1
tarry	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
until	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
Mormon	1
811	1
11	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
us	1
Mormon	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
whoso	1
receiveth	1
this	1
record	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
condemn	1
it	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
imperfections	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
greater	1
things	1
than	1
these	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Moroni	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
possible	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
Mormon	1
813	1
13	1
Behold	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
concerning	1
this	1
people	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mormon	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Mormon	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
hideth	1
up	1
this	1
record	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
plates	1
thereof	1
are	1
of	1
no	1
worth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
For	1
he	1
truly	1
saith	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
shall	1
have	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
gain	1
but	1
the	1
record	1
thereof	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
worth	1
and	1
whoso	1
shall	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
light	1
him	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
bless	1
Mormon	1
815	1
15	1
For	1
none	1
can	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
bring	1

For	1
do	1
we	1
not	1
read	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
no	1

neither	1

And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
imagined	1
up	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
a	1
god	1
who	1
doth	1
vary	1
and	1
in	1
whom	1
there	1
is	1
shadow	1
of	1
changing	1
then	1
have	1
ye	1
imagined	1
up	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
a	1
god	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
Mormon	1
911	1
11	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
even	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
same	1
God	1
who	1
created	1
the	1

the	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
in	1

Behold	1
he	1
created	1
Adam	1
and	1
by	1
Adam	1
came	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
man	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
because	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
came	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
man	1
Mormon	1
913	1
13	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
came	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
they	1
are	1
brought	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
this	1
is	1
wherein	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
redeemed	1
because	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Christ	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
resurrection	1
which	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
a	1
redemption	1
from	1
an	1
endless	1
sleep	1
from	1
which	1
sleep	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
the	1
trump	1
shall	1
sound	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
all	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
bar	1
being	1
redeemed	1
and	1
loosed	1
from	1
this	1
eternal	1
band	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
death	1
is	1
a	1
temporal	1
death	1
Mormon	1

And	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
filthy	1
shall	1
be	1
filthy	1
still	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
righteous	1

he	1
that	1

happy	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1

he	1
that	1
is	1
unhappy	1
shall	1
be	1
unhappy	1

Mormon	1

And	1
now	1
O	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
have	1
imagined	1
up	1
unto	1
yourselves	1
a	1
god	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
miracles	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
passed	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
Has	1
the	1
end	1
come	1
yet	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
and	1
God	1
has	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
Mormon	1
916	1
16	1
Behold	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
wrought	1
marvelous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes	1
Yea	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
comprehend	1
the	1
marvelous	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
Mormon	1
917	1
17	1
Who	1
shall	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
miracle	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
word	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
man	1
was	1
created	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
have	1
miracles	1
been	1
wrought	1
Mormon	1
918	1
18	1
And	1
who	1
shall	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
did	1
not	1
many	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
Mormon	1
919	1
19	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
then	1
why	1
has	1
God	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
an	1
unchangeable	1
Being	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
he	1
changeth	1
not	1
if	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
and	1
he	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
God	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
miracles	1
Mormon	1
920	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
ceaseth	1
to	1
do	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
because	1
that	1
they	1
dwindle	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
and	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
should	1
trust	1
Mormon	1
921	1
21	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
whoso	1
believeth	1
in	1
Christ	1
doubting	1
nothing	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
promise	1
is	1
unto	1
all	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Mormon	1
922	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
thus	1
said	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
who	1
should	1
tarry	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
disciples	1
in	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
Mormon	1
923	1
23	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
damned	1
Mormon	1
924	1
24	1
And	1
these	1
signs	1
shall	1
follow	1
them	1
that	1
believein	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
new	1
tongues	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
serpents	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
drink	1
any	1
deadly	1
thing	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
recover	1
Mormon	1
925	1
25	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
doubting	1
nothing	1
unto	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
confirm	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Mormon	1
926	1
26	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
who	1
can	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Who	1
can	1
deny	1
his	1
sayings	1
Who	1
will	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
almighty	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Who	1
will	1
despise	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Who	1
will	1
despise	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Christ	1
Behold	1
all	1
ye	1
who	1
are	1
despisers	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
wonder	1
and	1
perish	1
Mormon	1
927	1
27	1
O	1
then	1
despise	1
not	1
and	1
wonder	1
not	1
but	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
for	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
ye	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
Doubt	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
believing	1
and	1
begin	1
as	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
before	1
him	1
Mormon	1
928	1

Be	1
wise	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
probation	1
strip	1
yourselves	1
of	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
ask	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
consume	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
lusts	1
but	1
ask	1
with	1
a	1
firmness	1
unshaken	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
yield	1
to	1
no	1
temptation	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
serve	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
living	1
God	1
Mormon	1
929	1
29	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
baptized	1
unworthily	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
partake	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
Christ	1
unworthily	1
but	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
worthiness	1
and	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
endure	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
ye	1
will	1
in	1
nowise	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1

930	1

Behold	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
spake	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
my	1
words	1
Mormon	1
931	1
31	1
Condemn	1
me	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
mine	1
imperfection	1
neither	1
my	1
father	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
imperfection	1
neither	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
written	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
rather	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
you	1
our	1
imperfections	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
wise	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
Mormon	1
932	1
32	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
this	1
record	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
characters	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
among	1
us	1
the	1
reformed	1
Egyptian	1
being	1
handed	1
down	1
and	1
altered	1
by	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
manner	1
of	1
speech	1
Mormon	1
933	1
33	1
And	1
if	1
our	1
plates	1
had	1
been	1
sufficiently	1
large	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew	1
but	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
hath	1
been	1
altered	1
by	1
us	1
also	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew	1
behold	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
imperfection	1
in	1
our	1
record	1
Mormon	1
934	1
34	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
none	1
other	1
people	1
knoweth	1
our	1
language	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
none	1
other	1
people	1
knoweth	1
our	1
language	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
means	1
for	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
Mormon	1
935	1
35	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
written	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
rid	1
our	1
garments	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
who	1
have	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
Mormon	1
936	1
36	1
And	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
desired	1
concerning	1
our	1
brethren	1
yea	1
even	1
their	1
restoration	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Christ	1
are	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
who	1
have	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Mormon	1
937	1
37	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
grant	1
that	1
their	1
prayers	1
may	1
be	1
answered	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
and	1
may	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
remember	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
may	1
he	1
bless	1
them	1
forever	1
through	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1

THE	1
BOOK	1
OF	1
ETHER	1
The	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
Jaredites	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
twentyfour	1
plates	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
Ether	1
1	1
Chapter	1
1	1
Ether	1
11	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
proceed	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
those	1
ancient	1
inhabitants	1
who	1
were	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
north	1
country	1
Ether	1
12	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
take	1
mine	1
account	1
from	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
plates	1
which	1
were	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Limhi	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Book	1
of	1
Ether	1
Ether	1
13	1
3	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
record	1
which	1
speaks	1
concerning	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
Adam	1
and	1
an	1
account	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
tower	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
transpired	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
until	1
that	1
time	1
is	1
had	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1

14	1
4	1
Therefore	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
transpired	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Adam	1
until	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
plates	1
and	1
whoso	1
findeth	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
will	1
have	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
get	1
the	1
full	1
account	1
Ether	1
15	1
5	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
give	1
not	1
the	1
full	1
account	1
but	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
account	1
I	1
give	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
down	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
destroyed	1
Ether	1
16	1
6	1
And	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
do	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
account	1
He	1
that	1
wrote	1
this	1
record	1
was	1
Ether	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Coriantor	1

Coriantor	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1

And	1
Moron	1
was	1
the	1
son	1

And	1
Ethem	1

unto	1

not	1

And	1
it	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jared	1
spake	1
again	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
saying	1
Go	1
and	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
whether	1
he	1

whither	1

And	1
if	1
it	1

it	1
for	1
our	1
inheritance	1

39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1

of	1
Jared	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1

140	1
40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
hear	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
had	1
compassion	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Ether	1

41	1
Go	1
to	1
and	1
gather	1
together	1
thy	1

both	1

thy	1

thy	1

142	1
42	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
is	1
northward	1
And	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
meet	1
thee	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
thee	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
the	1

Ether	1
143	1
43	1
And	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
nation	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
unto	1
thee	1
because	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
ye	1
have	1
cried	1
unto	1
me	1
Ether	1
2	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Ether	1
21	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
was	1
northward	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
was	1
Nimrod	1
being	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Ether	1
22	1
2	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
lay	1
snares	1
and	1
catch	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
prepare	1
a	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
carry	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
Ether	1
23	1
3	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
also	1
carry	1
with	1
them	1
deseret	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
a	1
honey	1
bee	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
carry	1
with	1
them	1
swarms	1
of	1
bees	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
seeds	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
Ether	1
24	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Nimrod	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
Ether	1
25	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
yea	1
into	1
that	1
quarter	1
where	1
there	1
never	1
had	1
man	1
been	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
go	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
talk	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
gave	1
directions	1
whither	1
they	1
should	1
travel	1
Ether	1
26	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
did	1
build	1
barges	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
cross	1
many	1
waters	1
being	1
directed	1
continually	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
27	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
stop	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
forth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
which	1
was	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
had	1
preserved	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
people	1
Ether	1
28	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
that	1
whoso	1
should	1
possess	1
this	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
henceforth	1
and	1
forever	1
should	1
serve	1
him	1
the	1
true	1
and	1
only	1
God	1
or	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
swept	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
Ether	1
29	1
9	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
can	1
behold	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
God	1
concerning	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
promise	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
nation	1
shall	1
possess	1
it	1
shall	1
serve	1
God	1
or	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
swept	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
And	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
ripened	1
in	1
iniquity	1
Ether	1
210	1
10	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
wherefore	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
possess	1
it	1
shall	1
serve	1
God	1
or	1
shall	1
be	1
swept	1
off	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
everlasting	1
decree	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
iniquity	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
swept	1
off	1
Ether	1
211	1
11	1
And	1
this	1
cometh	1
unto	1
you	1
O	1
ye	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Godthat	1
ye	1
may	1
repent	1
and	1
not	1
continue	1
in	1
your	1
iniquities	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
come	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
have	1
hitherto	1
done	1
Ether	1
212	1
12	1
Behold	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
choice	1
land	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
nation	1
shall	1
possess	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
bondage	1
and	1
from	1
captivity	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
nations	1
under	1
heaven	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
but	1
serve	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
who	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
manifested	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
Ether	1
213	1
13	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
proceed	1
with	1
my	1
record	1
for	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
bring	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
forth	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
great	1
sea	1
which	1
divideth	1
the	1
lands	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Moriancumer	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents	1
upon	1
the	1
seashore	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
Ether	1
214	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
did	1
the	1
Lord	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
chastened	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
remembered	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
215	1
15	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
did	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
his	1
brethren	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
forgive	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
sin	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
remember	1
that	1
my	1
Spirit	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
strive	1
with	1
man	1
wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
sin	1
until	1
ye	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
thoughts	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
inheritance	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
land	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
Ether	1
216	1
16	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
Go	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
build	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
barges	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
hitherto	1
built	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
did	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
built	1
barges	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
built	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
instructions	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
small	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
even	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
a	1
fowl	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
Ether	1
217	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
built	1
after	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
tight	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
hold	1
water	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
the	1
bottom	1
thereof	1
was	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
the	1
sides	1
thereof	1
were	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
the	1
ends	1
thereof	1
were	1
peaked	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
thereof	1
was	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
thereof	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
shut	1
was	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
Ether	1
218	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
barges	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
directed	1
me	1
Ether	1
219	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
in	1
them	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
whither	1
shall	1
we	1
steer	1
And	1
also	1
we	1
shall	1
perish	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
we	1
cannot	1
breathe	1
save	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
air	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
therefore	1
we	1
shall	1
perish	1
Ether	1
220	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
Behold	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
suffer	1
for	1
air	1
thou	1
shalt	1
unstop	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
receive	1
air	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
come	1
in	1
upon	1
thee	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
stop	1
the	1
hole	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
not	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
Ether	1
221	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
did	1
so	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
commanded	1
Ether	1
222	1
22	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
O	1
Lord	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
the	1
vessels	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
behold	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
them	1
Behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
cross	1
this	1
great	1
water	1
in	1
darkness	1
Ether	1
223	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
light	1
in	1
your	1
vessels	1
For	1
behold	1
ye	1
cannot	1
have	1
windows	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
take	1
fire	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
fire	1
Ether	1
224	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
the	1
mountain	1
waves	1
shall	1
dash	1
upon	1
you	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
up	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
the	1
winds	1
have	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
rains	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
forth	1
Ether	1
225	1
25	1
And	1
behold	1
I	1
prepare	1
you	1
against	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
ye	1
cannot	1
cross	1
this	1
great	1
deep	1
save	1
I	1
prepare	1
you	1
against	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
which	1
have	1
gone	1
forth	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
Therefore	1
what	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prepare	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
light	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1

Chapter	1

Ether	1
31	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
now	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
was	1
eight	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
Shelem	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
exceeding	1
height	1
and	1
did	1
molten	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
sixteen	1
small	1
stones	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
clear	1
even	1
as	1
transparent	1
glass	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
carry	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
and	1
cried	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
saying	1
Ether	1
32	1
2	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
encompassed	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
floods	1
Now	1
behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
weakness	1
before	1
thee	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
holy	1
and	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
unworthy	1
before	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fall	1
our	1
natures	1
have	1
become	1
evil	1
continually	1
nevertheless	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
commandment	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
call	1
upon	1
thee	1
that	1
from	1
thee	1
we	1
may	1
receive	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
desires	1
Ether	1
33	1
3	1
Behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
iniquity	1
and	1
hast	1
driven	1
us	1
forth	1
and	1
for	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
nevertheless	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
merciful	1
unto	1
us	1
O	1
Lord	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
pity	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
thine	1
anger	1
from	1
this	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
suffer	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
across	1
this	1
raging	1
deep	1
in	1
darkness	1
but	1
behold	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
molten	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Ether	1
34	1
4	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
O	1
Lord	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
can	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
man	1
therefore	1
touch	1
these	1
stones	1
O	1
Lord	1
with	1
thy	1
finger	1
and	1
prepare	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
shine	1
forth	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
shine	1
forth	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
prepared	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
light	1
while	1
we	1
shall	1
cross	1
the	1
sea	1
Ether	1
35	1
5	1
Behold	1
O	1
Lord	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
this	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
forth	1
great	1
power	1
which	1
looks	1
small	1
unto	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
men	1
Ether	1
36	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
stones	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
And	1
the	1
veil	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
unto	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
fear	1
Ether	1
37	1
7	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Arise	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
fallen	1
Ether	1
38	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
I	1
feared	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
Ether	1
39	1
9	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Because	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
upon	1
me	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
and	1
never	1
has	1
man	1
come	1
before	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
exceeding	1
faith	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
for	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
finger	1
Sawest	1
thou	1
more	1
than	1
this	1
Ether	1
310	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
Nay	1
Lord	1
show	1
thyself	1
unto	1
me	1
Ether	1
311	1
11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Believest	1
thou	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
Ether	1
312	1
12	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
Yea	1
Lord	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
speakest	1
the	1
truth	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
canst	1
not	1
lie	1
Ether	1
313	1
13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
behold	1
the	1
Lord	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
Because	1
thou	1
knowest	1
these	1
things	1
ye	1
are	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
fall	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
brought	1
back	1
into	1
my	1
presence	1
therefore	1
I	1
show	1
myself	1
unto	1
you	1
Ether	1
314	1
14	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
prepared	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
redeem	1
my	1
people	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
In	1
me	1
shall	1
all	1
mankind	1
have	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
eternally	1
even	1
they	1
who	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
Ether	1
315	1
15	1
And	1
never	1
have	1
I	1
showed	1
myself	1
unto	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
for	1
never	1
has	1
man	1
believed	1
in	1
me	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
Seest	1
thou	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
created	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
image	1
Yea	1
even	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
created	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
image	1
Ether	1
316	1
16	1
Behold	1
this	1
body	1
which	1
ye	1
now	1
behold	1
is	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
man	1
have	1
I	1
created	1
after	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
appear	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
will	1
I	1
appear	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
Ether	1
317	1
17	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
Moroni	1
said	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
therefore	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
this	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
body	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Ether	1
318	1
18	1
And	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
the	1
Nephites	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
great	1
works	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
showed	1
unto	1
him	1
Ether	1
319	1
19	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
beholding	1
within	1
the	1
veil	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
Jesus	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
he	1
fell	1
with	1
fear	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
faith	1
no	1
longer	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
doubting	1
Ether	1
320	1
20	1
Wherefore	1
having	1
this	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
veil	1
therefore	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
him	1
Ether	1
321	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
Behold	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
cometh	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
glorify	1
my	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
treasure	1
up	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
Ether	1
322	1
22	1
And	1
behold	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
them	1
and	1
shall	1
seal	1
them	1
up	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
interpret	1
them	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
language	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
read	1
Ether	1
323	1
23	1
And	1
behold	1
these	1
two	1
stones	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
seal	1
them	1
up	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
Ether	1
324	1
24	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
language	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
I	1
have	1
confounded	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
that	1
these	1
stones	1
shall	1
magnify	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
men	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
write	1
Ether	1
325	1
25	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
showed	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
he	1
withheld	1
them	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
sight	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Ether	1
326	1
26	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
times	1
before	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
show	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
thingsit	1
should	1
be	1
shown	1
unto	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
could	1
not	1
withhold	1
anything	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
could	1
show	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
Ether	1
327	1
27	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Write	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
seal	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
due	1
time	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Ether	1
328	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
two	1
stones	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
show	1
them	1
not	1
until	1
the	1
Lord	1
should	1
show	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Ether	1
4	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Ether	1
41	1
1	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
forbidden	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
until	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
did	1
king	1
Mosiah	1
keep	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
until	1
after	1
Christ	1
should	1
show	1
himself	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
Ether	1
42	1
2	1
And	1
after	1
Christ	1
truly	1
had	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
he	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
Ether	1
43	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
dwindled	1
in	1
unbelief	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
commanded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hide	1
them	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
Ether	1
44	1
4	1
Behold	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
upon	1
these	1
plates	1
the	1
very	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
saw	1
and	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
greater	1
things	1
made	1
manifest	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
Ether	1
45	1
5	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
them	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
seal	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
commanded	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
sealed	1
up	1
the	1
interpreters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
46	1
6	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
become	1
clean	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
47	1
7	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
exercise	1
faith	1
in	1
me	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
did	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
become	1
sanctified	1
in	1
me	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
saw	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
unfolding	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
my	1
revelations	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
are	1
Ether	1
48	1
8	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
contend	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
deny	1
these	1
things	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed	1
for	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
show	1
no	1
greater	1
things	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
speaketh	1
Ether	1
49	1
9	1
And	1
at	1
my	1
command	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
opened	1
and	1
are	1
shut	1
and	1
at	1
my	1
word	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
shake	1
and	1
at	1
my	1
command	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
even	1
so	1
as	1
by	1
fire	1
Ether	1
410	1
10	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
my	1
words	1
believeth	1
not	1
my	1
disciples	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
judge	1
ye	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
that	1
speaketh	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
Ether	1
411	1
11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
visit	1
with	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
and	1
bear	1
record	1
For	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
for	1
it	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
Ether	1
412	1
12	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
is	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
good	1
cometh	1
of	1
none	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

that	1
leadeth	1
men	1
to	1
all	1

the	1
Father	1
who	1

For	1
behold	1
I	1

the	1

413	1
13	1
Come	1
unto	1
me	1
O	1
ye	1
Gentiles	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
greater	1
things	1
the	1
knowledge	1
which	1
is	1
hid	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
Ether	1
414	1
14	1
Come	1
unto	1
me	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
you	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
Ether	1
415	1
15	1
Behold	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
rend	1
that	1
veil	1
of	1
unbelief	1
which	1
doth	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
your	1
awful	1
state	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
hardness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
blindness	1
of	1
mind	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
hid	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
youyea	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
remembered	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
Ether	1
416	1
16	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
my	1
revelations	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
by	1
my	1
servant	1
John	1
be	1
unfolded	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
Remember	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
very	1
deed	1
Ether	1
417	1
17	1
Therefore	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
this	1
record	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
has	1
commenced	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
418	1
18	1
Therefore	1
repent	1
all	1
ye	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
gospel	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
damned	1
and	1
signs	1
shall	1
follow	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
Ether	1
419	1
19	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
found	1
faithful	1
unto	1
my	1
name	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1

And	1
now	1
I	1

according	1

I	1

And	1
unto	1

shall	1
they	1

And	1
in	1

all	1

And	1
if	1

I	1
Moroni	1
proceed	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Ether	1
62	1
2	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
prepared	1
the	1
stones	1
which	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
had	1
carried	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
came	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
stones	1
into	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
one	1
in	1
each	1
end	1
thereof	1
and	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
give	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
vessels	1
Ether	1
63	1
3	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Lord	1
caused	1
stones	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
darkness	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
unto	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
great	1
waters	1
in	1
darkness	1
Ether	1
64	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prepared	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
food	1
that	1
thereby	1
they	1
might	1
subsist	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
also	1
food	1
for	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
beast	1
or	1
animal	1
or	1
fowl	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
carry	1
with	1
themand	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
they	1
got	1
aboard	1
of	1
their	1
vessels	1
or	1
barges	1
and	1
set	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
commending	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God	1
Ether	1
65	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
caused	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
furious	1
wind	1
blow	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
towards	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
tossed	1
upon	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
Ether	1
66	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
many	1
times	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
waves	1
which	1
broke	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
tempests	1
which	1
were	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
Ether	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
that	1
could	1
hurt	1
them	1
their	1
vessels	1
being	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
tight	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
Noah	1
therefore	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
encompassed	1
about	1
by	1
many	1
waters	1
they	1
did	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
Ether	1
68	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
did	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
blow	1
towards	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
Ether	1
69	1
9	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
yea	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
did	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
thank	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
Lord	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
610	1
10	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
and	1
no	1
monster	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
could	1
break	1
them	1
neither	1
whale	1
that	1
could	1
mar	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
have	1
light	1
continually	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
above	1
the	1
water	1
or	1
under	1
the	1
water	1
Ether	1
611	1
11	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
forth	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
Ether	1
612	1
12	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
land	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
their	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
did	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
shed	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
tender	1
mercies	1
over	1
them	1
Ether	1
613	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
Ether	1
614	1
14	1
And	1
Jared	1
had	1
four	1
sons	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
Jacom	1
and	1
Gilgah	1
and	1
Mahah	1
and	1
Orihah	1
Ether	1
615	1
15	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
also	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
Ether	1
616	1
16	1
And	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
were	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
souls	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
many	1
Ether	1
617	1
17	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
taught	1
to	1
walk	1
humbly	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
taught	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
Ether	1
618	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
multiply	1
and	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
wax	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
619	1
19	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
soon	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jared	1
Let	1
us	1
gather	1
together	1
our	1
people	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
number	1
them	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
of	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
desire	1
of	1
us	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
our	1
graves	1
Ether	1
620	1
20	1
And	1
accordingly	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
Now	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
souls	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
of	1
Jared	1
were	1
twelve	1
he	1
having	1
four	1
sons	1
Ether	1
621	1
21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
number	1
their	1
people	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
numbered	1
them	1
they	1
did	1
desire	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
graves	1
Ether	1
622	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
desired	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
anoint	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
sons	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them	1
Ether	1
623	1
23	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
this	1
was	1
grievous	1
unto	1
them	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Surely	1
this	1
thing	1
leadeth	1
into	1
captivity	1
Ether	1
624	1
24	1
But	1
Jared	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
Suffer	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
And	1
therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Choose	1
ye	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
our	1
sons	1
a	1
king	1
even	1
whom	1
ye	1
will	1
Ether	1
625	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
chose	1
even	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Pagag	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
refused	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
should	1
constrain	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
constrain	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king	1
Ether	1
626	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
chose	1
all	1
the	1
brothers	1
of	1
Pagag	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
Ether	1
627	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
neither	1
would	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jared	1
even	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
one	1
and	1
Orihah	1
was	1
anointed	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
628	1
28	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
Ether	1
629	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jared	1
died	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
also	1
Ether	1
630	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Orihah	1
did	1
walk	1
humbly	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
did	1
remember	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
also	1
taught	1
his	1
people	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
their	1
fathers	1
Ether	1
7	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Ether	1
71	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Orihah	1
did	1
execute	1
judgment	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
righteousness	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
whose	1
days	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
many	1
Ether	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
he	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
yea	1
he	1
begat	1
thirty	1
and	1
one	1
among	1
whom	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
three	1
sons	1
Ether	1
73	1
3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
begat	1
Kib	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Kib	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
Kib	1
begat	1
Corihor	1
Ether	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
when	1
Corihor	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
he	1
rebelled	1
against	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nehor	1
and	1
he	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
wherefore	1
Corihor	1
drew	1
away	1
many	1
people	1
after	1
him	1
Ether	1
75	1
5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
together	1
an	1
army	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moron	1
where	1
the	1
king	1
dwelt	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
captive	1
which	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
captivity	1
Ether	1
76	1
6	1
Now	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moron	1
where	1
the	1
king	1
dwelt	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Desolation	1
by	1
the	1
Nephites	1
Ether	1
77	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Kib	1
dwelt	1
in	1
captivity	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
under	1
Corihor	1
his	1
son	1
until	1
he	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
old	1
nevertheless	1
Kib	1
begat	1
Shule	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
captivity	1
Ether	1
78	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shule	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
Shule	1
waxed	1
strong	1
and	1
became	1
mighty	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
mighty	1
in	1
judgment	1
Ether	1
79	1
9	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
molten	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
made	1
swords	1
out	1
of	1
steel	1
for	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
armed	1
them	1
with	1
swords	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
Nehor	1
and	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
Corihor	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
restored	1
it	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
Kib	1
Ether	1
710	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
Shule	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
father	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
kingdom	1
therefore	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Ether	1
711	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
spread	1
his	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
numerous	1
Ether	1
712	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shule	1
also	1
begat	1
many	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
Ether	1
713	1
13	1
And	1
Corihor	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
evils	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
wherefore	1
Shule	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom	1
Ether	1
714	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Corihor	1
had	1
many	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
And	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Corihor	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Noah	1
Ether	1
715	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Noah	1
rebelled	1
against	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
father	1
Corihor	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
Cohor	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
716	1
16	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
obtain	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
inheritance	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
717	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
again	1
unto	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Moron	1
Ether	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shule	1
crept	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Noah	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
and	1
broke	1
down	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
placed	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
kingdom	1
Ether	1
719	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Noah	1
did	1
build	1
up	1
his	1
kingdom	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
gain	1
power	1
any	1
more	1
over	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Shule	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
and	1
wax	1
great	1
Ether	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
divided	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
kingdoms	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Shule	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Cohor	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Noah	1
Ether	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
Cohor	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Noah	1
caused	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
should	1
give	1
battle	1
unto	1
Shule	1
in	1
which	1
Shule	1
did	1
beat	1
them	1
and	1
did	1
slay	1
Cohor	1
Ether	1
722	1
22	1
And	1
now	1
Cohor	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Nimrod	1
and	1
Nimrod	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Cohor	1
unto	1
Shule	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
gain	1
favor	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Shule	1
wherefore	1
Shule	1
did	1
bestow	1
great	1
favors	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Shule	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
desires	1
Ether	1
723	1
23	1
And	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Shule	1
there	1
came	1
prophets	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
prophesying	1
that	1
the	1
wickedness	1
and	1
idolatry	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
bringing	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
Ether	1
724	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
revile	1
against	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
did	1
mock	1
them	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
king	1
Shule	1
did	1
execute	1
judgment	1
against	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
revile	1
against	1
the	1
prophets	1
Ether	1
725	1
25	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
execute	1
a	1
law	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
would	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
repentance	1
Ether	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities	1
and	1
idolatries	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
spare	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
prosper	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shule	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
Ether	1
727	1
27	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
wars	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Shule	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
great	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
bringing	1
them	1
across	1
the	1
great	1
deep	1
into	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
righteousness	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
Ether	1
8	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Ether	1
81	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
begat	1
Omer	1
and	1
Omer	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
And	1
Omer	1
begat	1
Jared	1
and	1
Jared	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
Ether	1
82	1
2	1
And	1
Jared	1
rebelled	1
against	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Heth	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
flatter	1
many	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
cunning	1
words	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Ether	1
83	1
3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
carry	1
away	1
his	1
father	1
into	1
captivity	1
and	1
did	1
make	1
him	1
serve	1
in	1
captivity	1
Ether	1
84	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
reigns	1
of	1
Omer	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
captivity	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
among	1
whom	1
were	1
Esrom	1
and	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
85	1
5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Jared	1
their	1
brother	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
raise	1
an	1
army	1
and	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Jared	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
give	1
battle	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
night	1
Ether	1
86	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Jared	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
also	1
and	1
he	1
plead	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
slay	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
life	1
Ether	1
87	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
Jared	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sorrowful	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
upon	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Ether	1
88	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jared	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
expert	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
thought	1
to	1
devise	1
a	1
plan	1
whereby	1
she	1
could	1
redeem	1
the	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
her	1
father	1
Ether	1
89	1
9	1
Now	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jared	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
talk	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Whereby	1
hath	1
my	1
father	1
so	1
much	1
sorrow	1
Hath	1
he	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
record	1
which	1
our	1
fathers	1
brought	1
across	1
the	1
great	1
deep	1
Behold	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
an	1
account	1
concerning	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
that	1
they	1
by	1
their	1
secret	1
plans	1
did	1
obtain	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
great	1
glory	1
Ether	1
810	1
10	1
And	1
now	1
therefore	1
let	1
my	1
father	1
send	1
for	1
Akish	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kimnor	1
and	1
behold	1
I	1
am	1
fair	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dance	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
please	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
desire	1
me	1
to	1
wife	1
wherefore	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
desire	1
of	1
thee	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
me	1
to	1
wife	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
bring	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
the	1
king	1
Ether	1
811	1
11	1
And	1
now	1
Omer	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
Akish	1
wherefore	1
when	1
Jared	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
Akish	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jared	1
danced	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
pleased	1
him	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
desired	1
her	1
to	1
wife	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jared	1
Give	1
her	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
wife	1
Ether	1
812	1
12	1
And	1
Jared	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
unto	1
you	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
bring	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
the	1
king	1
Ether	1
813	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Akish	1
gathered	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jared	1
all	1
his	1
kinsfolk	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
Will	1
ye	1
swear	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
faithful	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
desire	1
of	1
you	1
Ether	1
814	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
sware	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
heads	1
that	1
whoso	1
should	1
vary	1
from	1
the	1
assistance	1
which	1
Akish	1
desired	1
should	1
lose	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
whoso	1
should	1
divulge	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
Akish	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
should	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
Ether	1
815	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
thus	1
they	1
did	1
agree	1
with	1
Akish	1
And	1
Akish	1
did	1
administer	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
oaths	1
which	1
were	1
given	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
who	1
also	1
sought	1
power	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
down	1
even	1
from	1
Cain	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
Ether	1
816	1
16	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
kept	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
to	1
administer	1
these	1
oaths	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
darkness	1
to	1
help	1
such	1
as	1
sought	1
power	1
to	1
gain	1
power	1
and	1
to	1
murder	1
and	1
to	1
plunder	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
whoredoms	1
Ether	1
817	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jared	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
search	1
up	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
Jared	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Akish	1
wherefore	1
Akish	1
administered	1
it	1
unto	1
his	1
kindred	1
and	1
friends	1
leading	1
them	1
away	1
by	1
fair	1
promises	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
he	1
desired	1
Ether	1
818	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
formed	1
a	1
secret	1
combination	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
of	1
old	1
which	1
combination	1
is	1
most	1
abominable	1
and	1
wicked	1
above	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
Ether	1
819	1
19	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
worketh	1
not	1
in	1
secret	1
combinations	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
will	1
that	1
man	1
should	1
shed	1
blood	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
hath	1
forbidden	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
man	1
Ether	1
820	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
oaths	1
and	1
combinations	1
for	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
had	1
among	1
all	1
people	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
had	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Ether	1
821	1
21	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
speaking	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nephi	1
Ether	1
822	1
22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
nation	1
shall	1
uphold	1
such	1
secret	1
combinations	1
to	1
get	1
power	1
and	1
gain	1
until	1
they	1
shall	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
nation	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
saints	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
shed	1
by	1
them	1
shall	1
always	1
cry	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
avenge	1
them	1
not	1
Ether	1
823	1
23	1
Wherefore	1
O	1
ye	1
Gentiles	1
it	1
is	1
wisdom	1
in	1
God	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
shown	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
thereby	1
ye	1
may	1
repent	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
suffer	1
not	1
that	1
these	1
murderous	1
combinations	1
shall	1
get	1
above	1
you	1
which	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
to	1
get	1
power	1
and	1
gainand	1
the	1

the	1

of	1
the	1

Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
commandeth	1
you	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
awake	1
to	1
a	1
sense	1

shall	1
be	1
among	1
you	1

wo	1
be	1
unto	1
it	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
slain	1
for	1
they	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1

for	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
also	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
built	1

up	1

For	1
it	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
whoso	1
buildeth	1
it	1
up	1
seeketh	1
to	1
overthrow	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
all	1

and	1
it	1
bringeth	1
to	1

the	1
destruction	1
of	1
all	1

for	1
it	1
is	1
built	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
lies	1
even	1
that	1
same	1
liar	1
who	1
beguiled	1
our	1
first	1

yea	1
even	1
that	1
same	1
liar	1
who	1
hath	1
caused	1
man	1
to	1
commit	1
murder	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
who	1
hath	1
hardened	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
have	1

Wherefore	1
I	1
Moroni	1
am	1
commanded	1
to	1
write	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
evil	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
may	1
come	1
that	1
Satan	1
may	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
upon	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
persuaded	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
continually	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness	1
and	1
be	1
saved	1

Chapter	1

Ether	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
proceed	1
with	1
my	1
record	1
Therefore	1
behold	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
combinations	1
of	1
Akish	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
behold	1
they	1
did	1
overthrow	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Omer	1
Ether	1
92	1
2	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
merciful	1
unto	1
Omer	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
daughters	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
seek	1
his	1
destruction	1
Ether	1
93	1
3	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
warned	1
Omer	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
wherefore	1
Omer	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
traveled	1
many	1
days	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Shim	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
by	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Nephites	1
were	1
destroyed	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
eastward	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Ablom	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
Jared	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
Ether	1
94	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Jared	1
was	1
anointed	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
wickedness	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Akish	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife	1
Ether	1
95	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Akish	1
sought	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
fatherinlaw	1
and	1
he	1
applied	1
unto	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
and	1
they	1
obtained	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
fatherinlaw	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
giving	1
audience	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
Ether	1
96	1
6	1
For	1
so	1
great	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
spreading	1
of	1
this	1
wicked	1
and	1
secret	1
society	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
corrupted	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
Jared	1
was	1
murdered	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
and	1
Akish	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Ether	1
97	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Akish	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
therefore	1
he	1
shut	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
prison	1
and	1
kept	1
him	1
upon	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
food	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
death	1
Ether	1
98	1
8	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
suffered	1
death	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Nimrah	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
Ether	1
99	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Nimrah	1
gathered	1
together	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
Omer	1
Ether	1
910	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Akish	1
begat	1
other	1
sons	1
and	1
they	1
won	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
had	1
sworn	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
iniquity	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
Ether	1
911	1
11	1
Now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Akish	1
were	1
desirous	1
for	1
gain	1
even	1
as	1
Akish	1
was	1
desirous	1
for	1
power	1
wherefore	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Akish	1
did	1
offer	1
them	1
money	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
they	1
drew	1
away	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
after	1
them	1
Ether	1
912	1
12	1
And	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Akish	1
and	1
Akish	1
which	1
lasted	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
yea	1
unto	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
yea	1
even	1
all	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
thirty	1
souls	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
fled	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Omer	1
Ether	1
913	1
13	1
Wherefore	1
Omer	1
was	1
restored	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
Ether	1
914	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Omer	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
nevertheless	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
he	1
begat	1
Emer	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
Emer	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Ether	1
915	1
15	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
anointed	1
Emer	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
he	1
saw	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
having	1
seen	1
exceedingly	1
many	1
days	1
which	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
sorrow	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Emer	1
did	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
did	1
fill	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Ether	1
916	1
16	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
curse	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Emer	1
did	1
prosper	1
exceedingly	1
under	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Emer	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
sixty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
rich	1
Ether	1
917	1
17	1
Having	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fruit	1
and	1
of	1
grain	1
and	1
of	1
silks	1
and	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
and	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
precious	1
things	1
Ether	1
918	1
18	1
And	1
also	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
cattle	1
of	1
oxen	1
and	1
cows	1
and	1
of	1
sheep	1
and	1
of	1
swine	1
and	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1
animals	1
which	1
were	1
useful	1
for	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
man	1
Ether	1
919	1
19	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
had	1
horses	1
and	1
asses	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
elephants	1
and	1
cureloms	1
and	1
cumoms	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
useful	1
unto	1
man	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
the	1
elephants	1
and	1
cureloms	1
and	1
cumoms	1
Ether	1
920	1
20	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
pour	1
out	1
his	1
blessings	1
upon	1
this	1
land	1
which	1
was	1
choice	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
that	1
whoso	1
should	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
should	1
possess	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
or	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ripened	1
in	1
iniquity	1
for	1
upon	1
such	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
my	1
wrath	1
Ether	1
921	1
21	1
And	1
Emer	1
did	1
execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
righteousness	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
he	1
begat	1
many	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
and	1
he	1
begat	1
Coriantum	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
Coriantum	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Ether	1
922	1
22	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
anointed	1
Coriantum	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
he	1
lived	1
four	1
years	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
and	1
he	1
even	1
saw	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
Righteousness	1
and	1
did	1
rejoice	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
peace	1
Ether	1
923	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantum	1
did	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
did	1
build	1
many	1
mighty	1
cities	1
and	1
did	1
administer	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
children	1
even	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
old	1
Ether	1
924	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
died	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantum	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
a	1
young	1
maid	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
wherefore	1
he	1
lived	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
Ether	1
925	1
25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
begat	1
Com	1
and	1
Com	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
forty	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
and	1
he	1
begat	1
Heth	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
begat	1
other	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
Ether	1
926	1
26	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
spread	1
again	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
wickedness	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
Heth	1
began	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
secret	1
plans	1
again	1
of	1
old	1
to	1
destroy	1
his	1
father	1
Ether	1
927	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
dethrone	1
his	1
father	1
for	1
he	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
Ether	1
928	1
28	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
again	1
crying	1
repentance	1
unto	1
themthat	1
they	1
must	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
or	1
there	1
should	1
come	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
even	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
famine	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
repent	1
Ether	1
929	1
29	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
but	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
cast	1
into	1
pits	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
perish	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Heth	1
Ether	1
930	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
dearth	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
exceedingly	1
fast	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dearth	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1

And	1
there	1
came	1
forth	1
poisonous	1
serpents	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
did	1
poison	1
many	1
people	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
their	1
flocks	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
poisonous	1
serpents	1
towards	1
the	1

southward	1
which	1
was	1
called	1

out	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

after	1
the	1

Morianton	1
he	1
being	1
a	1

gathered	1
together	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
outcasts	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
gained	1
power	1
over	1
many	1
cities	1

the	1

became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1

establish	1
himself	1
king	1
over	1
all	1

And	1
after	1
that	1

he	1
did	1
ease	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1

by	1
which	1
he	1

him	1
to	1
be	1
their	1

And	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
justice	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
but	1
not	1
unto	1
himself	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
many	1
whoredoms	1
wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
1012	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1

wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
not	1

of	1
the	1

Ether	1
1014	1
14	1
And	1

which	1
he	1

And	1
after	1

he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

the	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Com	1
drew	1
away	1
the	1

he	1
reigned	1
over	1

Now	1

And	1
there	1

And	1
it	1

that	1

And	1
the	1

in	1

And	1
it	1

And	1
there	1

And	1
they	1

not	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

because	1
of	1
their	1

wherefore	1

in	1

And	1
the	1

inasmuch	1

And	1
it	1

And	1
it	1

would	1
not	1

And	1
it	1

And	1

Chapter	1

121	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Ether	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
Coriantumr	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1

Ether	1
122	1
2	1
And	1
Ether	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1

wherefore	1
Ether	1
came	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
restrained	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
Ether	1
123	1
3	1
For	1
he	1
did	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
exhorting	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
God	1
unto	1
repentance	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
by	1
faith	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
fulfilled	1
Ether	1
124	1
4	1
Wherefore	1
whoso	1
believeth	1
in	1
God	1
might	1
with	1
surety	1
hope	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
world	1
yea	1
even	1
a	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
hope	1
cometh	1
of	1
faith	1
maketh	1
an	1
anchor	1
to	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
men	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
sure	1
and	1
steadfast	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
good	1
works	1
being	1
led	1
to	1
glorify	1
God	1
Ether	1
125	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ether	1
did	1
prophesy	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
them	1
not	1
Ether	1
126	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
would	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
would	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
faith	1
is	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
hoped	1
for	1
and	1
not	1
seen	1
wherefore	1
dispute	1
not	1
because	1
ye	1
see	1
not	1
for	1
ye	1
receive	1
no	1
witness	1
until	1
after	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
Ether	1
127	1
7	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
Christ	1
showed	1
himself	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
not	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
until	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
wherefore	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
some	1
had	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
showed	1
himself	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
Ether	1
128	1
8	1
But	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
has	1
shown	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
glorified	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
prepared	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
thereby	1
others	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
hope	1
for	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
Ether	1
129	1
9	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
hope	1
and	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
but	1
have	1
faith	1
Ether	1
1210	1
10	1
Behold	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
they	1
of	1
old	1
were	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
holy	1
order	1
of	1
God	1
Ether	1
1211	1
11	1
Wherefore	1
by	1
faith	1
was	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
given	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
hath	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
way	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
Ether	1
1212	1
12	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
faith	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
God	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
miracle	1
among	1
them	1
wherefore	1
he	1
showed	1
not	1
himself	1
until	1
after	1
their	1
faith	1
Ether	1
1213	1
13	1
Behold	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Alma	1
and	1
Amulek	1
that	1
caused	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
Ether	1
1214	1
14	1
Behold	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Nephi	1
and	1
Lehi	1
that	1
wrought	1
the	1
change	1
upon	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
Ether	1
1215	1
15	1
Behold	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
which	1
wrought	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
miracle	1
among	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Ether	1
1216	1
16	1
Yea	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
they	1
who	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
wrought	1
them	1
by	1
faith	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
Christ	1
and	1
also	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
after	1
Ether	1
1217	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
disciples	1
obtained	1
a	1
promise	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
they	1
obtained	1
not	1
the	1
promise	1
until	1
after	1
their	1
faith	1

1218	1
18	1
And	1
neither	1

hath	1
any	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
until	1
after	1
their	1
faith	1
wherefore	1
they	1
first	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
Ether	1
1219	1
19	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
whose	1
faith	1
was	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
strong	1
even	1
before	1
Christ	1
came	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
veil	1
but	1
truly	1
saw	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
beheld	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
Ether	1
1220	1
20	1
And	1
behold	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
this	1
record	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
his	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
that	1
when	1
God	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
finger	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
obtained	1
by	1
faith	1
Ether	1
1221	1
21	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
had	1
beheld	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
had	1
obtained	1
by	1
faith	1
the	1
Lord	1
could	1
not	1
withhold	1
anything	1
from	1
his	1
sight	1
wherefore	1
he	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
kept	1
without	1
the	1
veil	1
Ether	1
1222	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
obtained	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
through	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
yea	1
even	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
Ether	1
1223	1
23	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
Lord	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
will	1
mock	1
at	1
these	1
things	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
weakness	1
in	1
writing	1
for	1
Lord	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
mighty	1
in	1
word	1
by	1
faith	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
made	1
us	1
mighty	1
in	1
writing	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
speak	1
much	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
Ether	1
1224	1
24	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
write	1
but	1
little	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
our	1
hands	1
Behold	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
made	1
us	1
mighty	1
in	1
writing	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
for	1
thou	1
madest	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
were	1
mighty	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
unto	1
the	1
overpowering	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
Ether	1
1225	1
25	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
made	1
our	1
words	1
powerful	1
and	1
great	1
even	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
write	1
them	1
wherefore	1
when	1
we	1
write	1
we	1
behold	1
our	1
weakness	1
and	1
stumble	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
placing	1
of	1
our	1
words	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
mock	1
at	1
our	1
words	1
Ether	1
1226	1
26	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1
Fools	1
mock	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
mourn	1
and	1
my	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
meek	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
advantage	1
of	1
your	1
weakness	1
Ether	1
1227	1
27	1
And	1
if	1
men	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
them	1
their	1
weakness	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
men	1
weakness	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
humble	1
and	1
my	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
humble	1
themselves	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
me	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
weak	1
things	1
become	1
strong	1
unto	1
them	1
Ether	1
1228	1
28	1
Behold	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
their	1
weakness	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
faith	1
hope	1
and	1
charity	1
bringeth	1
unto	1
methe	1
fountain	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness	1
Ether	1
1229	1
29	1
And	1
I	1
Moroni	1
having	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
was	1
comforted	1
and	1
said	1
O	1
Lord	1
thy	1
righteous	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
workest	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
faith	1
Ether	1
1230	1
30	1
For	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Jared	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
mountain	1
Zerin	1
Removeand	1
it	1
was	1
removed	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
faith	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
moved	1
wherefore	1
thou	1
workest	1
after	1
men	1
have	1
faith	1
Ether	1
1231	1
31	1
For	1
thus	1
didst	1
thou	1
manifest	1
thyself	1
unto	1
thy	1
disciples	1
for	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
faith	1
and	1
did	1
speak	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
thou	1
didst	1
show	1
thyself	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
great	1
power	1
Ether	1
1232	1
32	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
a	1
house	1
for	1
man	1
yea	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
mansions	1
of	1
thy	1
Father	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
hope	1
wherefore	1
man	1
must	1
hope	1
or	1
he	1
cannot	1
receive	1
an	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
Ether	1
1233	1
33	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
the	1
world	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
laying	1
down	1
of	1
thy	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
take	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Ether	1
1234	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
is	1
charity	1
wherefore	1
except	1
men	1
shall	1
have	1
charity	1
they	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
that	1
place	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
mansions	1
of	1
thy	1
Father	1
Ether	1
1235	1
35	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
not	1
charity	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
weakness	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
prove	1
them	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
talent	1
yea	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
and	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
Ether	1
1236	1
36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
grace	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
charity	1
Ether	1
1237	1
37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
charity	1
it	1
mattereth	1
not	1
unto	1
thee	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
wherefore	1
thy	1
garments	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
clean	1
And	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
thy	1
weakness	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
made	1
strong	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
mansions	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
Ether	1
1238	1
38	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
bid	1
farewell	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
yea	1
and	1
also	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
until	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
before	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Christ	1
where	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
garments	1
are	1
not	1
spotted	1
with	1
your	1
blood	1
Ether	1
1239	1
39	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
Jesus	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
plain	1
humility	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
telleth	1
another	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
language	1
concerning	1
these	1
things	1
Ether	1
1240	1
40	1
And	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
weakness	1
in	1
writing	1
Ether	1
1241	1
41	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
would	1
commend	1
you	1
to	1
seek	1
this	1
Jesus	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
apostles	1
have	1
written	1
that	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
beareth	1
record	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
you	1
forever	1
Amen	1

131	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
proceed	1
to	1
finish	1
my	1
record	1
concerning	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
writing	1
Ether	1
132	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
rejected	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ether	1
for	1
he	1
truly	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
waters	1
had	1
receded	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
choice	1
land	1
above	1
all	1
other	1
lands	1
a	1
chosen	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
have	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
should	1
serve	1
him	1
who	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
thereof	1
Ether	1
133	1
3	1
And	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Ether	1
134	1
4	1
Behold	1
Ether	1
saw	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
a	1
New	1
Jerusalem	1
upon	1
this	1
land	1
Ether	1
135	1
5	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
whence	1
Lehi	1
should	1
comeafter	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
up	1
again	1
a	1
holy	1
city	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
wherefore	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
old	1
but	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
become	1
a	1
holy	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
Ether	1
136	1
6	1
And	1
that	1
a	1
New	1
Jerusalem	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
upon	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
for	1
which	1
things	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
type	1

137	1

For	1
as	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
his	1
father	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
so	1
he	1
died	1
there	1
wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
brought	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
merciful	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Joseph	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
perish	1
not	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
merciful	1
unto	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Joseph	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
perish	1
not	1
Ether	1
138	1

Wherefore	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
upon	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
up	1
a	1
holy	1
city	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Jerusalem	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
confounded	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
come	1
when	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
Ether	1
139	1
9	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
heaven	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
old	1
save	1
the	1
old	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
become	1
new	1

1310	1
10	1
And	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
New	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
dwell	1
therein	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
whose	1
garments	1
are	1
white	1
through	1
the	1

And	1
then	1

cometh	1
the	1

the	1

thereof	1
blessed	1

they	1

the	1

And	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write	1
more	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
forbidden	1
but	1
great	1
and	1
marvelous	1
were	1
the	1
prophecies	1
of	1
Ether	1
but	1
they	1
esteemed	1
him	1
as	1
naught	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
cavity	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
viewing	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
1314	1
14	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cavity	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
record	1
viewing	1
the	1
destructions	1
which	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
night	1
Ether	1
1315	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
year	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
war	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
who	1
rose	1
up	1
who	1
were	1
mighty	1
men	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
Coriantumr	1
by	1
their	1
secret	1
plans	1
of	1
wickedness	1
of	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
spoken	1
Ether	1
1316	1
16	1
And	1
now	1
Coriantumr	1
having	1
studied	1
himself	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cunning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
wherefore	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
Ether	1
1317	1
17	1
But	1
he	1
repented	1
not	1
neither	1
his	1
fair	1
sons	1
nor	1
daughters	1
neither	1
the	1
fair	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
of	1
Cohor	1
neither	1
the	1
fair	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
of	1
Corihor	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
who	1
repented	1
of	1
their	1
sins	1
Ether	1
1318	1
18	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
that	1
Ether	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cavity	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
those	1
secret	1
combinations	1
fighting	1
against	1
Coriantumr	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
Ether	1
1319	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
fought	1
much	1
and	1
bled	1
much	1
Ether	1
1320	1
20	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
to	1
Ether	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
Coriantumr	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
repent	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
the	1
Lord	1
would	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
spare	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
1321	1
21	1
Otherwise	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
himself	1
And	1
he	1
should	1
only	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
another	1
people	1
receiving	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
their	1
inheritance	1
and	1
Coriantumr	1
should	1
receive	1
a	1
burial	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
every	1
soul	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
1322	1
22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
repented	1
not	1
neither	1
his	1
household	1
neither	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
wars	1
ceased	1
not	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
Ether	1
but	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
hid	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
cavity	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Ether	1
1323	1
23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
up	1
Shared	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
beat	1
him	1
insomuch	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
he	1
did	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
captivity	1
Ether	1
1324	1
24	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
did	1
beat	1
Shared	1
and	1
did	1
obtain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
father	1
Ether	1
1325	1
25	1
Now	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
war	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
band	1
fighting	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
Ether	1
1326	1
26	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
robbers	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
wickedness	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
1327	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
with	1
Shared	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
armies	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
meet	1
in	1
great	1
anger	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
meet	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gilgal	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
Ether	1
1328	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shared	1
fought	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
beat	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
pursue	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Heshlon	1
Ether	1
1329	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shared	1
gave	1
him	1
battle	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
plains	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
did	1
beat	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
drove	1
him	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gilgal	1
Ether	1
1330	1
30	1
And	1
Coriantumr	1
gave	1
Shared	1
battle	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gilgal	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
beat	1
Shared	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
Ether	1
1331	1
31	1
And	1
Shared	1
wounded	1
Coriantumr	1
in	1
his	1
thigh	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
in	1
which	1
time	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
were	1
shedding	1
blood	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
restrain	1
them	1
Ether	1
14	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Ether	1
141	1
1	1
And	1
now	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
curse	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
lay	1
his	1
tool	1
or	1
his	1
sword	1
upon	1
his	1
shelf	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
it	1
behold	1
upon	1
the	1
morrow	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
curse	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
142	1
2	1
Wherefore	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
cleave	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
borrow	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
lend	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
kept	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
Ether	1
143	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
after	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Shared	1
behold	1
there	1
arose	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Shared	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Coriantumr	1
in	1
which	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
beat	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
pursue	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Akish	1
Ether	1
144	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Shared	1
did	1
give	1
battle	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Akish	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
and	1
many	1
thousands	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Ether	1
145	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
lay	1
siege	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Shared	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
slew	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
drunken	1
Ether	1
146	1
6	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moron	1
and	1
placed	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
147	1
7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
dwelt	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
receive	1
great	1
strength	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
Ether	1
148	1
8	1
Now	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Shared	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Gilead	1
also	1
received	1
great	1
strength	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
because	1
of	1
secret	1
combinations	1
Ether	1
149	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
his	1
high	1
priest	1
murdered	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne	1
Ether	1
1410	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
combinations	1
murdered	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
pass	1
and	1
obtained	1
unto	1
himself	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Lib	1
and	1
Lib	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
stature	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
1411	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Lib	1
Coriantumr	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moron	1
and	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Lib	1
Ether	1
1412	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
fought	1
with	1
Lib	1
in	1
which	1
Lib	1
did	1
smite	1
upon	1
his	1
arm	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wounded	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
press	1
forward	1
upon	1
Lib	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
upon	1
the	1
seashore	1
Ether	1
1413	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
pursued	1
him	1
and	1
Lib	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
seashore	1
Ether	1
1414	1
14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lib	1
did	1
smite	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Akish	1
Ether	1
1415	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Lib	1
did	1
pursue	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Agosh	1
And	1
Coriantumr	1
had	1
taken	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
before	1
Lib	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
he	1
fled	1
Ether	1
1416	1
16	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Agosh	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Lib	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
upon	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
died	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Lib	1
did	1
come	1
against	1
Coriantumr	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Coriantumr	1
fled	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Lib	1
Ether	1
1417	1
17	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Lib	1
was	1
called	1
Shiz	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shiz	1
pursued	1
after	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
overthrow	1
many	1
cities	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
slay	1
both	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
burn	1
the	1
cities	1
Ether	1
1418	1
18	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
a	1
fear	1
of	1
Shiz	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
yea	1
a	1
cry	1
went	1
forth	1
throughout	1
the	1
landWho	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Shiz	1
Behold	1
he	1
sweepeth	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
him	1
Ether	1
1419	1
19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
flock	1
together	1
in	1
armies	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
Ether	1
1420	1
20	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
divided	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Shiz	1
and	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
1421	1
21	1
And	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
lasting	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
bloodshed	1
and	1
carnage	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
Ether	1
1422	1
22	1
And	1
so	1
swift	1
and	1
speedy	1
was	1
the	1
war	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
left	1
to	1
bury	1
the	1
dead	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
to	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
leaving	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
both	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
strewed	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
the	1
worms	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
Ether	1
1423	1
23	1
And	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
went	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
became	1
troubled	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
Ether	1
1424	1
24	1
Nevertheless	1
Shiz	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pursue	1
Coriantumr	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
avenge	1
himself	1
upon	1
Coriantumr	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Ether	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
should	1
not	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Ether	1
1425	1
25	1
And	1
thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
visit	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
and	1
their	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
had	1
prepared	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
their	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
Ether	1
1426	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shiz	1
did	1
pursue	1
Coriantumr	1
eastward	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
borders	1
by	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
gave	1
battle	1
unto	1
Shiz	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
Ether	1
1427	1
27	1
And	1
so	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
destruction	1
among	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Shiz	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Corihor	1
and	1
swept	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
before	1
them	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
join	1
them	1
Ether	1
1428	1
28	1
And	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Corihor	1
and	1
Coriantumr	1
pitched	1
his	1
tents	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shurr	1
Now	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shurr	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
hill	1
Comnor	1
wherefore	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
gather	1
his	1
armies	1
together	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
Comnor	1
and	1
did	1
sound	1
a	1
trumpet	1
unto	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Shiz	1
to	1
invite	1
them	1
forth	1
to	1
battle	1
Ether	1
1429	1
29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
but	1
were	1
driven	1
again	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
became	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
Ether	1
1430	1
30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Shiz	1
smote	1
upon	1
Coriantumr	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
many	1
deep	1
wounds	1
and	1
Coriantumr	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
blood	1
fainted	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
dead	1
Ether	1
1431	1
31	1
Now	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
Shiz	1
commanded	1
his	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
pursue	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
wherefore	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
camp	1
Ether	1
15	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Ether	1
151	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Coriantumr	1
had	1
recovered	1
of	1
his	1
wounds	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Ether	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him	1
Ether	1
152	1
2	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
already	1
nearly	1
two	1
millions	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
sorrow	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
yea	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
slain	1
two	1
millions	1
of	1
mighty	1
men	1
and	1
also	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
Ether	1
153	1
3	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fulfilled	1
thus	1
far	1
every	1
whit	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
mourned	1
and	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted	1
Ether	1
154	1
4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
wrote	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
Shiz	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
spare	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
155	1
5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Shiz	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
epistle	1
he	1
wrote	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
Coriantumr	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
slay	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
spare	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
156	1
6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
were	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Shiz	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Shiz	1
were	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Shiz	1
did	1
give	1
battle	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
157	1
7	1
And	1
when	1
Coriantumr	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
he	1
fled	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Shiz	1
Ether	1
158	1
8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Ripliancum	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
large	1
or	1
to	1
exceed	1
all	1
wherefore	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
these	1
waters	1
they	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents	1
and	1
Shiz	1
also	1
pitched	1
his	1
tents	1
near	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
did	1
come	1
to	1
battle	1
Ether	1
159	1
9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
fought	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
sore	1
battle	1
in	1
which	1
Coriantumr	1
was	1
wounded	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
fainted	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
Ether	1
1510	1
10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
press	1
upon	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Shiz	1
that	1
they	1
beat	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
flee	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
flee	1
southward	1
and	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
called	1
Ogath	1
Ether	1
1511	1
11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
did	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
by	1
the	1
hill	1
Ramah	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
same	1
hill	1
where	1
my	1
father	1
Mormon	1
did	1
hide	1
up	1
the	1
records	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
which	1
were	1
sacred	1
Ether	1
1512	1
12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
gather	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
slain	1
save	1
it	1
was	1
Ether	1
Ether	1
1513	1
13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Ether	1
did	1
behold	1
all	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
for	1
Coriantumr	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
for	1
Shiz	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Shiz	1
Ether	1
1514	1
14	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
gathering	1
together	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
get	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
receive	1
Ether	1
1515	1
15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
gathered	1
together	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
with	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
their	1
childrenboth	1
men	1

being	1
armed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1

having	1

and	1
breastplates	1
and	1
headplates	1
and	1
being	1
clothed	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
warthey	1
did	1
march	1
forth	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
conquered	1
not	1
Ether	1
1516	1
16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
they	1
were	1
weary	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
their	1
camps	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
their	1
camps	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
howling	1
and	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
their	1
people	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
were	1
their	1
cries	1
their	1
howlings	1
and	1
lamentations	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
rend	1
the	1
air	1
exceedingly	1
Ether	1
1517	1
17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
did	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
that	1
day	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
conquered	1
not	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
again	1
they	1
did	1
rend	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
their	1
cries	1
and	1
their	1
howlings	1
and	1
their	1
mournings	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
their	1
people	1
Ether	1
1518	1
18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
wrote	1
again	1
an	1
epistle	1
unto	1
Shiz	1
desiring	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
spare	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
Ether	1
1519	1
19	1
And	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
ceased	1
striving	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
Satan	1
had	1
full	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
minds	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed	1
wherefore	1
they	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
Ether	1
1520	1
20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
fought	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
they	1
slept	1
upon	1
their	1
swords	1
Ether	1
1521	1
21	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
fought	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
Ether	1
1522	1
22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
they	1
were	1
drunken	1
with	1
anger	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
drunken	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
they	1
slept	1
again	1
upon	1
their	1
swords	1
Ether	1
1523	1
23	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
fought	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
fifty	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
the	1

sixty	1
and	1
nine	1
of	1
the	1

of	1

1524	1
24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1

that	1
they	1
slept	1
upon	1
their	1
swords	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
fought	1
again	1
and	1
they	1
contended	1
in	1
their	1
might	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
shields	1
all	1
that	1
day	1

1525	1
25	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
came	1
there	1
were	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1

twenty	1
and	1
seven	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
Coriantumr	1
Ether	1
1526	1
26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
ate	1
and	1
slept	1
and	1
prepared	1
for	1
death	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
large	1

mighty	1
men	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
men	1
Ether	1
1527	1
27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
they	1
fought	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
and	1
they	1
fainted	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
Ether	1
1528	1
28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Coriantumr	1
had	1
received	1
sufficient	1
strength	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
walk	1
they	1

about	1
to	1
flee	1
for	1

but	1
behold	1
Shiz	1
arose	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
men	1
and	1
he	1
swore	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
slay	1
Coriantumr	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
perish	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
Ether	1
1529	1

Wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
pursue	1
them	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
he	1
did	1
overtake	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
save	1
it	1
were	1
Coriantumr	1
and	1
Shiz	1
behold	1
Shiz	1
had	1
fainted	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
blood	1
Ether	1
1530	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
when	1
Coriantumr	1
had	1
leaned	1
upon	1
his	1
sword	1
that	1
he	1
rested	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
smote	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Shiz	1

And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
smitten	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Shiz	1
that	1
Shiz	1
raised	1
upon	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
fell	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
struggled	1
for	1
breath	1
he	1
died	1
Ether	1
1532	1
32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
Coriantumr	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1

and	1
became	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
no	1

And	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1

said	1
unto	1
him	1
Go	1
forth	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
beheld	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
fulfilled	1

he	1
finished	1
his	1

part	1
I	1

Now	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
which	1
are	1

are	1
these	1
Whether	1
the	1

will	1
that	1
I	1

that	1
I	1

unto	1

they	1
came	1
forth	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit	1
and	1
witnessed	1
unto	1

that	1
they	1
truly	1
repented	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
Moroni	1

none	1

serve	1

And	1

were	1
wrought	1
upon	1
and	1
cleansed	1
by	1
the	1

they	1
were	1
numbered	1

the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1

their	1

that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
remembered	1
and	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
the	1

unto	1

was	1
the	1
author	1
and	1
the	1
finisher	1
of	1
their	1
faith	1
Moroni	1
65	1

And	1
the	1
church	1
did	1
meet	1
together	1
oft	1
to	1
fast	1
and	1
to	1
pray	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
concerning	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
Moroni	1
66	1

And	1
they	1
did	1
meet	1
together	1
oft	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
wine	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Moroni	1
67	1
7	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
strict	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
iniquity	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
whoso	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
commit	1
iniquity	1
and	1
three	1
witnesses	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
did	1
condemn	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
and	1
confessed	1
not	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
blotted	1
out	1

they	1

But	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
they	1
repented	1
and	1
sought	1
forgiveness	1
with	1
real	1
intent	1
they	1
were	1
forgiven	1
Moroni	1
69	1

And	1
their	1
meetings	1
were	1
conducted	1
by	1
the	1

after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
workings	1

1	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
write	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Mormon	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
faith	1
hope	1
and	1
charity	1
for	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
he	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
worship	1
Moroni	1
72	1
2	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
Mormon	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
and	1
his	1
holy	1
will	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
his	1
calling	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
Moroni	1
73	1
3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
peaceable	1
followers	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
that	1
have	1
obtained	1
a	1
sufficient	1
hope	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
can	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
henceforth	1
until	1
ye	1
shall	1
rest	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
heaven	1
Moroni	1
74	1
4	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
I	1
judge	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
peaceable	1
walk	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Moroni	1
75	1
5	1
For	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
saith	1
by	1
their	1
works	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
for	1
if	1
their	1
works	1
be	1
good	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
good	1
also	1
Moroni	1
76	1
6	1
For	1
behold	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
evil	1
cannot	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
offereth	1
a	1
gift	1
or	1
prayeth	1
unto	1
God	1
except	1
he	1

nothing	1
Moroni	1
77	1

For	1
behold	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness	1
Moroni	1
78	1
8	1
For	1
behold	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
evil	1
giveth	1
a	1
gift	1
he	1
doeth	1
it	1
grudgingly	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
retained	1
the	1
gift	1
wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
counted	1
evil	1
before	1
God	1
Moroni	1
79	1
9	1
And	1
likewise	1
also	1
is	1
it	1
counted	1
evil	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
real	1
intent	1
of	1
heart	1
yea	1
and	1
it	1
profiteth	1
him	1
nothing	1
for	1
God	1
receiveth	1
none	1
such	1
Moroni	1
710	1
10	1
Wherefore	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
evil	1
cannot	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
a	1
good	1
gift	1
Moroni	1
711	1
11	1
For	1
behold	1
a	1
bitter	1
fountain	1
cannot	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
water	1
neither	1
can	1
a	1
good	1
fountain	1
bring	1
forth	1
bitter	1
water	1
wherefore	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
cannot	1
follow	1
Christ	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
follow	1
Christ	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Moroni	1
712	1
12	1
Wherefore	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
good	1
cometh	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
an	1
enemy	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
fighteth	1
against	1
him	1
continually	1
and	1
inviteth	1
and	1
enticeth	1
to	1
sin	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil	1
continually	1
Moroni	1
713	1
13	1
But	1
behold	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
inviteth	1
and	1
enticeth	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
continually	1
wherefore	1
every	1
thing	1
which	1
inviteth	1
and	1
enticeth	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
is	1
inspired	1
of	1
God	1
Moroni	1
714	1
14	1
Wherefore	1
take	1
heed	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
judge	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
Moroni	1
715	1
15	1
For	1
behold	1
my	1
brethren	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
judge	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
judge	1
is	1
as	1
plain	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
as	1
the	1
daylight	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
dark	1
night	1
Moroni	1
716	1
16	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
know	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
wherefore	1
I	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
every	1
thing	1
which	1
inviteth	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
persuade	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
Christ	1
is	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
gift	1
of	1
Christ	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
Moroni	1
717	1
17	1
But	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
and	1
believe	1
not	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
deny	1
him	1
and	1
serve	1
not	1
God	1
then	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
for	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
doth	1
the	1
devil	1
work	1
for	1
he	1
persuadeth	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
no	1
not	1
one	1
neither	1
do	1
his	1
angels	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
who	1
subject	1
themselves	1
unto	1
him	1
Moroni	1
718	1
18	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
light	1
by	1
which	1
ye	1
may	1
judge	1
which	1
light	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
Christ	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
judge	1
wrongfully	1
for	1
with	1
that	1
same	1
judgment	1
which	1
ye	1
judge	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
be	1
judged	1
Moroni	1
719	1
19	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
of	1
you	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
search	1
diligently	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
Christ	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
good	1
from	1
evil	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
and	1
condemn	1
it	1
not	1
ye	1
certainly	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
Christ	1
Moroni	1
720	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
brethren	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
Moroni	1
721	1
21	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
faith	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
way	1
whereby	1
ye	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
Moroni	1
722	1
22	1
For	1
behold	1
God	1
knowing	1
all	1
things	1
being	1
from	1
everlasting	1
to	1
everlasting	1
behold	1
he	1
sent	1
angels	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
make	1
manifest	1
concerning	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
in	1
Christ	1
there	1
should	1
come	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
Moroni	1
723	1
23	1
And	1
God	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
prophets	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
mouth	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
come	1
Moroni	1
724	1
24	1
And	1
behold	1
there	1
were	1
divers	1
ways	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
manifest	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
good	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
good	1
cometh	1
of	1
Christ	1
otherwise	1
men	1
were	1
fallen	1
and	1
there	1
could	1
no	1
good	1
thing	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
Moroni	1
725	1
25	1
Wherefore	1
by	1
the	1
ministering	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
which	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
God	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
exercise	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
thus	1
by	1
faith	1
they	1
did	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
until	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Moroni	1
726	1
26	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
men	1
also	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
by	1
faith	1
they	1
become	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
And	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
Christ	1
liveth	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
saying	1
Whatsoever	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
faith	1
believing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
behold	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
you	1
Moroni	1
727	1
27	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
have	1
miracles	1
ceased	1
because	1
Christ	1
hath	1
ascended	1
into	1
heaven	1
and	1
hath	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
claim	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
his	1
rights	1
of	1
mercy	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Moroni	1
728	1
28	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
answered	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
he	1
claimeth	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
will	1
cleave	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
wherefore	1
he	1
advocateth	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
eternally	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
Moroni	1
729	1
29	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
have	1
miracles	1
ceased	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
neither	1
have	1
angels	1
ceased	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Moroni	1
730	1
30	1
For	1
behold	1
they	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
minister	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
command	1
showing	1
themselves	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
strong	1
faith	1
and	1
a	1
firm	1
mind	1
in	1
every	1
form	1
of	1
godliness	1
Moroni	1
731	1
31	1
And	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
their	1
ministry	1
is	1
to	1
call	1
men	1
unto	1
repentance	1
and	1
to	1
fulfill	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
declaring	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
the	1
chosen	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bear	1
testimony	1
of	1
him	1
Moroni	1
732	1
32	1
And	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
prepareth	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
men	1
may	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
may	1
have	1
place	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
thereof	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
bringeth	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
Father	1
the	1
covenants	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Moroni	1
733	1
33	1
And	1
Christ	1
hath	1
said	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
me	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
is	1
expedient	1
in	1
me	1
Moroni	1
734	1
34	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
Repent	1
all	1
ye	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
saved	1
Moroni	1
735	1
35	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
true	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
has	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
miracles	1
ceased	1
Moroni	1
736	1
36	1
Or	1
have	1
angels	1
ceased	1
to	1
appear	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Or	1
has	1
he	1
withheld	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
from	1
them	1
Or	1
will	1
he	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
time	1
shall	1
last	1
or	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
stand	1
or	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
thereof	1
to	1
be	1
saved	1
Moroni	1
737	1
37	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Nay	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
miracles	1
are	1
wrought	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
angels	1
appear	1
and	1
minister	1
unto	1
men	1
wherefore	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
ceased	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
and	1
all	1
is	1
vain	1
Moroni	1
738	1
38	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
saved	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
save	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
wherefore	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
ceased	1
then	1
has	1
faith	1
ceased	1
also	1
and	1
awful	1
is	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
redemption	1
made	1
Moroni	1
739	1
39	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
judge	1
better	1
things	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
I	1
judge	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
meekness	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
then	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
church	1
Moroni	1
740	1
40	1
And	1
again	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
I	1
would	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
hope	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
attain	1
unto	1
faith	1
save	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
hope	1
Moroni	1
741	1
41	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
hope	1
for	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
hope	1
through	1
the	1
atonement	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal	1
and	1
this	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise	1
Moroni	1
742	1
42	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
faith	1
he	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
hope	1
for	1
without	1
faith	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
hope	1
Moroni	1
743	1
43	1
And	1
again	1
behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
have	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
save	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
of	1
heart	1
Moroni	1
744	1
44	1
If	1
so	1
his	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
is	1
vain	1
for	1
none	1
is	1
acceptable	1
before	1
God	1

And	1
charity	1
suffereth	1
long	1
and	1
is	1
kind	1
and	1
envieth	1

Wherefore	1
my	1

if	1

ye	1

cleave	1

for	1
all	1

But	1
charity	1
is	1
the	1
pure	1
love	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
it	1
endureth	1
forever	1
and	1
whoso	1

Wherefore	1
my	1

pray	1
unto	1
the	1

An	1

of	1
my	1

Mormon	1
written	1
to	1
me	1
Moroni	1
and	1
it	1
was	1

unto	1
me	1
soon	1
after	1
my	1
calling	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
And	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
did	1
he	1
write	1
unto	1
me	1
saying	1

82	1
2	1
My	1
beloved	1
son	1
Moroni	1
I	1
rejoice	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
your	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
to	1
his	1
ministry	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
holy	1
work	1
Moroni	1
83	1

I	1
am	1
mindful	1
of	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers	1
continually	1
praying	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Holy	1
Child	1
Jesus	1
that	1
he	1
through	1
his	1
infinite	1
goodness	1
and	1
grace	1
will	1
keep	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
endurance	1
of	1

on	1
his	1

to	1
the	1

Moroni	1
84	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
that	1
which	1
grieveth	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
for	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
disputations	1
rise	1
among	1
you	1
Moroni	1
85	1

For	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
the	1
truth	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
disputations	1
among	1
you	1
concerning	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
your	1
little	1
children	1
Moroni	1
86	1

And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
labor	1
diligently	1
that	1
this	1
gross	1
error	1
should	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
for	1
for	1
this	1
intent	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
this	1
epistle	1
Moroni	1
87	1
7	1
For	1
immediately	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
learned	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
concerning	1
the	1
matter	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
saying	1
Moroni	1
88	1
8	1
Listen	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
your	1
Redeemer	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
your	1
God	1
Behold	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance	1
the	1
whole	1
need	1
no	1
physician	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick	1
wherefore	1
little	1
children	1
are	1
whole	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
capable	1
of	1
committing	1
sin	1
wherefore	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
Adam	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
circumcision	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
me	1
Moroni	1
89	1
9	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
manifest	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
me	1
wherefore	1
my	1
beloved	1
son	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
solemn	1
mockery	1
before	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
baptize	1
little	1
children	1
Moroni	1
810	1
10	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
thing	1
shall	1
ye	1
teachrepentance	1
and	1
baptism	1
unto	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
accountable	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
committing	1
sin	1
yea	1
teach	1
parents	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
repent	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
and	1
humble	1
themselves	1
as	1
their	1
little	1
children	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
saved	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
children	1
Moroni	1
811	1
11	1
And	1
their	1
little	1
children	1
need	1
no	1
repentance	1
neither	1
baptism	1
Behold	1
baptism	1
is	1
unto	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
Moroni	1
812	1
12	1
But	1
little	1
children	1
are	1
alive	1
in	1
Christ	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
not	1
so	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
partial	1
God	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
changeable	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
respecter	1
to	1
persons	1
for	1
how	1
many	1
little	1
children	1
have	1
died	1
without	1
baptism	1
Moroni	1
813	1
13	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
little	1
children	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
saved	1
without	1
baptism	1
these	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
an	1
endless	1
hell	1
Moroni	1
814	1
14	1
Behold	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
supposeth	1
that	1
little	1
children	1
need	1
baptism	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
iniquity	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
neither	1
faith	1
hope	1
nor	1
charity	1
wherefore	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
Moroni	1
815	1
15	1
For	1
awful	1
is	1
the	1
wickedness	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
God	1
saveth	1
one	1
child	1
because	1
of	1
baptism	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
must	1
perish	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
baptism	1
Moroni	1
816	1
16	1
Wo	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
shall	1
pervert	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
Behold	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
boldness	1
having	1
authority	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
not	1
what	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
perfect	1
love	1
casteth	1
out	1
all	1
fear	1
Moroni	1
817	1
17	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
charity	1
which	1
is	1
everlasting	1
love	1
wherefore	1
all	1
children	1
are	1
alike	1
unto	1
me	1
wherefore	1
I	1
love	1
little	1
children	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
love	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
alike	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
salvation	1
Moroni	1
818	1
18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
partial	1
God	1
neither	1
a	1
changeable	1
being	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
unchangeable	1
from	1
all	1
eternity	1
to	1
all	1
eternity	1
Moroni	1
819	1
19	1
Little	1
children	1
cannot	1
repent	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
awful	1
wickedness	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
pure	1
mercies	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
alive	1
in	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
mercy	1
Moroni	1
820	1

And	1
he	1
that	1
saith	1
that	1
little	1
children	1
need	1
baptism	1
denieth	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
setteth	1
at	1

the	1

of	1
him	1

the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
redemption	1
Moroni	1
821	1
21	1
Wo	1
unto	1
such	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
death	1
hell	1
and	1
an	1
endless	1
torment	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
boldly	1
God	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
Listen	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
give	1
heed	1
or	1
they	1
stand	1
against	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
judgmentseat	1
of	1
Christ	1

822	1

For	1
behold	1
that	1
all	1

are	1
alive	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
the	1

For	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
redemption	1
cometh	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
law	1
wherefore	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
condemned	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
under	1
no	1
condemnation	1
cannot	1
repent	1
and	1
unto	1
such	1
baptism	1
availeth	1
nothing	1
Moroni	1
823	1
23	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
mockery	1
before	1
God	1
denying	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
and	1
putting	1

in	1
dead	1

24	1
Behold	1
my	1
son	1
this	1
thing	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
repentance	1
is	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
condemnation	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
law	1
Moroni	1
825	1
25	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
fruits	1
of	1
repentance	1
is	1
baptism	1
and	1
baptism	1
cometh	1
by	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
commandments	1
bringeth	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
Moroni	1
826	1
26	1
And	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
bringeth	1
meekness	1
and	1
lowliness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
meekness	1
and	1
lowliness	1
of	1
heart	1
cometh	1
the	1
visitation	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
Comforter	1
filleth	1
with	1
hope	1
and	1
perfect	1
love	1
which	1
love	1
endureth	1
by	1
diligence	1
unto	1

shall	1
come	1
when	1
all	1
the	1

shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
God	1
Moroni	1
827	1
27	1
Behold	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
out	1
soon	1
against	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Behold	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
this	1
nation	1
or	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Nephites	1
hath	1
proven	1
their	1
destruction	1
except	1

should	1
repent	1

828	1
28	1
Pray	1
for	1
them	1
my	1

that	1
repentance	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
them	1
But	1
behold	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
Spirit	1
hath	1
ceased	1
striving	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
they	1
are	1
also	1
seeking	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
which	1
cometh	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
denying	1
the	1
Holy	1

829	1
29	1
And	1
after	1
rejecting	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
knowledge	1
my	1
son	1
they	1
must	1
perish	1
soon	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1

Farewell	1

My	1

unto	1
you	1
again	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
yet	1

but	1
I	1
write	1
somewhat	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
grievous	1
Moroni	1
92	1
2	1
For	1
behold	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
sore	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
conquer	1
and	1
Archeantus	1
has	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
also	1
Luram	1
and	1
Emron	1
yea	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
choice	1
men	1
Moroni	1
93	1
3	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
shall	1
destroy	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
repent	1
and	1
Satan	1
stirreth	1
them	1
up	1
continually	1
to	1
anger	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
Moroni	1
94	1

Behold	1
I	1
am	1
laboring	1
with	1
them	1
continually	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
sharpness	1
they	1
tremble	1
and	1
anger	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
use	1
no	1
sharpness	1
they	1
harden	1
their	1
hearts	1
against	1
it	1
wherefore	1
I	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
ceased	1
striving	1
with	1
them	1
Moroni	1
95	1
5	1
For	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
do	1
they	1
anger	1
that	1
it	1
seemeth	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
lost	1
their	1
love	1
one	1
towards	1
another	1
and	1
they	1
thirst	1
after	1
blood	1
and	1
revenge	1
continually	1
Moroni	1
96	1
6	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
beloved	1
son	1
notwithstanding	1
their	1
hardness	1
let	1
us	1
labor	1
diligently	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
cease	1
to	1
labor	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
under	1
condemnation	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
labor	1
to	1
perform	1
whilst	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
clay	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
conquer	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness	1
and	1
rest	1
our	1
souls	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
Moroni	1
97	1
7	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
somewhat	1
concerning	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
For	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
from	1
Amoron	1
behold	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
many	1
prisoners	1
which	1
they	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Sherrizah	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
Moroni	1
98	1
8	1
And	1
the	1
husbands	1
and	1
fathers	1
of	1
those	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
and	1
they	1
feed	1
the	1
women	1
upon	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
husbands	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
upon	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
and	1
no	1
water	1
save	1
a	1
little	1
do	1
they	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
Moroni	1
99	1
9	1
And	1
notwithstanding	1
this	1
great	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
it	1
doth	1
not	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
our	1
people	1
in	1
Moriantum	1
For	1
behold	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
have	1
they	1
taken	1
prisoners	1
and	1
after	1
depriving	1
them	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
most	1
dear	1
and	1
precious	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
is	1
chastity	1
and	1
virtue	1
Moroni	1
910	1
10	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
they	1
did	1
murder	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
cruel	1
manner	1
torturing	1
their	1
bodies	1
even	1
unto	1
death	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
they	1
devour	1
their	1
flesh	1
like	1
unto	1
wild	1
beasts	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
bravery	1
Moroni	1
911	1
11	1
O	1
my	1
beloved	1
son	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
people	1
like	1
this	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
civilization	1
Moroni	1
912	1
12	1
And	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
civil	1
and	1
a	1
delightsome	1
people	1
Moroni	1
913	1
13	1
But	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
how	1
can	1
a	1
people	1
like	1
this	1
whose	1
delight	1
is	1
in	1
so	1
much	1
abomination	1
Moroni	1
914	1
14	1
How	1
can	1
we	1
expect	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
stay	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
judgment	1
against	1
us	1
Moroni	1
915	1
15	1
Behold	1
my	1
heart	1
cries	1
Wo	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
Come	1
out	1
in	1
judgment	1
O	1
God	1
and	1
hide	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
wickedness	1
and	1
abominations	1
from	1
before	1
thy	1
face	1
Moroni	1
916	1
16	1
And	1
again	1
my	1
son	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
widows	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
who	1
remain	1
in	1
Sherrizah	1
and	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
provisions	1
which	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
away	1
behold	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Zenephi	1
has	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
wander	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
can	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
many	1
old	1
women	1
do	1
faint	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
die	1
Moroni	1
917	1
17	1
And	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
weak	1
and	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
are	1
betwixt	1
Sherrizah	1
and	1
me	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Aaron	1
have	1
fallen	1
victims	1
to	1
their	1
awful	1
brutality	1
Moroni	1
918	1
18	1
O	1
the	1
depravity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
They	1
are	1
without	1
order	1
and	1
without	1
mercy	1
Behold	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
but	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
any	1
longer	1
enforce	1
my	1
commands	1
Moroni	1
919	1
19	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
strong	1
in	1
their	1
perversion	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
alike	1
brutal	1
sparing	1
none	1
neither	1
old	1
nor	1
young	1
and	1
they	1
delight	1
in	1
everything	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
our	1
women	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
doth	1
exceed	1
everything	1
yea	1
tongue	1
cannot	1
tell	1
neither	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
written	1
Moroni	1
920	1
20	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
dwell	1
no	1
longer	1
upon	1
this	1
horrible	1
scene	1
Behold	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
principle	1
and	1
past	1
feeling	1
and	1
their	1
wickedness	1
doth	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
Moroni	1
921	1
21	1
Behold	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
cannot	1
recommend	1
them	1
unto	1
God	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
me	1
Moroni	1
922	1
22	1
But	1
behold	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
recommend	1
thee	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
Christ	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
saved	1
and	1
I	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
spare	1
thy	1
life	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
unto	1
him	1
or	1
their	1
utter	1
destruction	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
perish	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
him	1
Moroni	1
923	1
23	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
perish	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Jaredites	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wilfulness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
seeking	1
for	1
blood	1
and	1
revenge	1
Moroni	1
924	1
24	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
perish	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
have	1
deserted	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
will	1
also	1
desert	1
over	1
unto	1
them	1
wherefore	1
write	1
somewhat	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
spared	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
perish	1
and	1
not	1
see	1
thee	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
thee	1
soon	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sacred	1
records	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
deliver	1
up	1
unto	1
thee	1
Moroni	1
925	1
25	1
My	1
son	1
be	1
faithful	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
grieve	1
thee	1
to	1
weigh	1
thee	1
down	1
unto	1
death	1
but	1
may	1
Christ	1
lift	1
thee	1
up	1
and	1
may	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
showing	1
his	1
body	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
life	1
rest	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
forever	1
Moroni	1
926	1
26	1
And	1
may	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
whose	1
throne	1
is	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
who	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
until	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
become	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
be	1
and	1
abide	1
with	1
you	1
forever	1

Moroni	1
101	1
1	1
Now	1
I	1
Moroni	1
write	1
somewhat	1
as	1
seemeth	1
me	1
good	1
and	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
the	1
Lamanites	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
away	1
since	1
the	1
sign	1
was	1
given	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Christ	1
Moroni	1
102	1
2	1
And	1
I	1
seal	1
up	1
these	1
records	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
exhortation	1
unto	1
you	1
Moroni	1
103	1
3	1
Behold	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
read	1
these	1
things	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
wisdom	1
in	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
read	1
them	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
remember	1
how	1
merciful	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
been	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
Adam	1
even	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
ponder	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
Moroni	1
104	1
4	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
ask	1
God	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
true	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
with	1
a	1
sincere	1
heart	1
with	1
real	1
intent	1
having	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
he	1
will	1
manifest	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
Moroni	1
105	1
5	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
Moroni	1
106	1
6	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
is	1
good	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
wherefore	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
denieth	1
the	1
Christ	1
but	1
acknowledgeth	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Moroni	1
107	1
7	1
And	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
wherefore	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
deny	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
he	1
worketh	1
by	1
power	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
the	1
same	1
today	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
forever	1
Moroni	1
108	1
8	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
deny	1
not	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
many	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
different	1
ways	1
that	1
these	1
gifts	1
are	1
administered	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
who	1
worketh	1
all	1
in	1
all	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
manifestations	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
profit	1
them	1
Moroni	1
109	1
9	1
For	1
behold	1
to	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
wisdom	1
Moroni	1
1010	1
10	1
And	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
knowledge	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit	1
Moroni	1
1011	1
11	1
And	1
to	1
another	1
exceedingly	1
great	1
faith	1
and	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit	1
Moroni	1
1012	1
12	1
And	1
again	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
work	1
mighty	1
miracles	1
Moroni	1
1013	1
13	1
And	1
again	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
prophesy	1
concerning	1
all	1
things	1
Moroni	1
1014	1
14	1
And	1
again	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
beholding	1
of	1
angels	1
and	1
ministering	1
spirits	1
Moroni	1
1015	1
15	1
And	1
again	1
to	1
another	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues	1
Moroni	1
1016	1
16	1
And	1
again	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
languages	1
and	1
of	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues	1
Moroni	1
1017	1
17	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
gifts	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
severally	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
will	1
Moroni	1
1018	1
18	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
that	1
every	1
good	1
gift	1
cometh	1
of	1
Christ	1
Moroni	1
1019	1
19	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday	1
today	1
and	1
forever	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
gifts	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual	1
never	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
even	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
stand	1
only	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
unbelief	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
Moroni	1
1020	1
20	1
Wherefore	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
faith	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
faith	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
hope	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
hope	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
charity	1
Moroni	1
1021	1
21	1
And	1
except	1
ye	1
have	1
charity	1
ye	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
neither	1
can	1
ye	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
if	1

Moroni	1

And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
hope	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
despair	1
cometh	1
because	1
of	1
iniquity	1
Moroni	1
1023	1
23	1
And	1
Christ	1
truly	1
said	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
expedient	1
unto	1
me	1
Moroni	1
1024	1
24	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earththat	1
if	1
the	1
day	1
cometh	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
away	1
among	1
you	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
Moroni	1
1025	1
25	1
And	1
wo	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
among	1
you	1
no	1
not	1
one	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
one	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
he	1
shall	1
work	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
God	1
Moroni	1
1026	1
26	1
And	1
wo	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
away	1
and	1
die	1
for	1
they	1
die	1
in	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
I	1
lie	1
not	1
Moroni	1
1027	1
27	1
And	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
remember	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
speedily	1
cometh	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
lie	1
not	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
declare	1
my	1
words	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
by	1
this	1
man	1
like	1
as	1
one	1
crying	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
yea	1
even	1
as	1
one	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
Moroni	1
1028	1
28	1
I	1
declare	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
prophecies	1
And	1
behold	1
they	1
shall	1
proceed	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
shall	1
hiss	1
forth	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
Moroni	1
1029	1
29	1
And	1
God	1
shall	1
show	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
is	1
true	1
Moroni	1
1030	1
30	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
would	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
come	1
unto	1
Christ	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
every	1
good	1
gift	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
evil	1
gift	1
nor	1
the	1
unclean	1
thing	1
Moroni	1
1031	1
31	1
And	1
awake	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
O	1
Jerusalem	1
yea	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
beautiful	1
garments	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
and	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
stakes	1
and	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
borders	1
forever	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
confounded	1
that	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Father	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
unto	1
thee	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
Moroni	1
1032	1
32	1
Yea	1
come	1
unto	1
Christ	1
and	1
be	1
perfected	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
deny	1
yourselves	1
of	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
deny	1
yourselves	1
of	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
love	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
might	1
mind	1
and	1
strength	1
then	1
is	1
his	1
grace	1
sufficient	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
ye	1
are	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
ye	1
can	1
in	1
nowise	1
deny	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
Moroni	1
1033	1
33	1
And	1
again	1
if	1
ye	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
and	1
deny	1
not	1
his	1
power	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
sanctified	1
in	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
shedding	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
unto	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
your	1
sins	1
that	1
ye	1
become	1
holy	1
without	1
spot	1
Moroni	1
1034	1
34	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
bid	1
unto	1
all	1
farewell	1
I	1
soon	1
go	1
to	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God	1
until	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
body	1
shall	1
again	1
reunite	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
brought	1
forth	1
triumphant	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
pleasing	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Jehovah	1
the	1
Eternal	1
Judge	1
of	1
both	1
quick	1
and	1
dead	1
Amen	1
